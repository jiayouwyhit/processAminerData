The main idea is that each record yields a bitstring @@@@ (\u201crecord signature\u201d), according to the values of its attributes. The binary value (@@@@)2 of this string decides the bucket that the record is stored. In this paper we propose to use Gray codes instead of binary codes, in order to map record signatures to buckets. In Gray codes, successive codewords differ in the value of exactly one bit position, thus, successive buckets hold records with similar record signatures. The proposed method achieves better clustering of similar records and avoids some of the (expensive) random disk accesses, replacing them with sequential ones. We develop a mathematical model, derive formulas giving the average performance of both methods and show that the proposed method achieves 0% - 50% relative savings over the binary codes. We also discuss how Gray codes could be applied to some retrieval methods designed for range queries, such as the grid file [Nievergelt84a] and the approach based on the so-called z-ordering [Orenstein84a].", "year": "1986", "venue": "SIGMOD '86 Proceedings of the 1986 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data", "citations": ["5390979920f70186a0e00fef", "5390981d20f70186a0e06117", "5390985d20f70186a0e06ef0", "5390990f20f70186a0e102f3", "5390995d20f70186a0e148b8", "539087a120f70186a0d46857", "53909fca20f70186a0e45001", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4b356", "5390a25820f70186a0e5e886", "5390aa7620f70186a0eac3c5", "5390af8820f70186a0ecee56", "5390b19020f70186a0edede2", "5390b19020f70186a0edf461", "5390b4c320f70186a0efcf5c", "5390b56a20f70186a0f0491a", "5390b5ed20f70186a0f0d355", "5390b71120f70186a0f1df93", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2875f", "558aca8d612c41e6b9d3a3c1", "539087e120f70186a0d64e9e", "539087eb20f70186a0d6a40d", "539087f320f70186a0d6f85e", "5390880720f70186a0d7949e", "5390881720f70186a0d805a9", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa97", "539089d220f70186a0d9ab5c", "539089d320f70186a0d9b45c", "53908a7420f70186a0da4491", "53908a9620f70186a0da4feb", "53908a9720f70186a0da6411", "53908a9720f70186a0da65d2", "5390879220f70186a0d3c62a", "53908b4920f70186a0dbb09c", "5390879920f70186a0d41e24"], "references": ["539098dc20f70186a0e0dabf", "5390878a20f70186a0d37d43", "539087f820f70186a0d72769", "539087f820f70186a0d72ba9", "539087f820f70186a0d72c83", "539087f820f70186a0d72cc3", "539087f820f70186a0d72cd2", "5390880d20f70186a0d7b22c", "5390880d20f70186a0d7b15f", "5390880d20f70186a0d7b196", "5390893e20f70186a0d928e8", "5390893e20f70186a0d9398f", "539090c420f70186a0dddc7d"], "authors": ["Christos Faloutsos"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a813c60b4bee2deaa7af"}}, {"index": "5390878320f70186a0d32596", "title": "Description and performance analysis of signature file methods for office filing", "abstract": "Signature files have attracted a lot of interest as an access method for text and specifically for messages in the office environment.

We give tight lower bounds on the achievable Fd and show that a simple relationship holds between the two quantities in the case of optimal signature extraction with uniform occurrence and query frequencies.

Specifically, the author illustrates the improved clustering of similar records that Gray codes can achieve with multiattribute hashing. Gray codes are used instead of binary codes to map record signatures to buckets. In Gray codes, successive codewords differ in the value of exactly one bit position; thus, successive buckets hold records with similar record signatures. The proposed method achieves better clustering of similar records, thus reducing the I/O time. A mathematical model is developed to derive formulas giving the average performance of both methods, and it is shown that the proposed method achieves 0-50% relative savings over the binary codes. The author also discusses how Gray codes could be applied to some retrieval methods designed for range queries, such as the grid file and the approach based on the so-called z-ordering. Gray codes are also used to design good distance-preserving functions, which map a k-dimensional (k-D) space into a one-dimensional one, in such a way that points are close in the k-D space are likely to be close in the 1-D space.", "year": "1988", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering", "citations": ["5390879d20f70186a0d42e4c", "5390981d20f70186a0e06117", "5390994d20f70186a0e131ce", "539099b320f70186a0e19bd7", "539099b320f70186a0e1b7da", "53909e7c20f70186a0e2c59d", "53909e8a20f70186a0e2cd52", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2efa1", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3f43f", "5390a1d420f70186a0e56e18", "5390a63c20f70186a0e8155d", "5390877f20f70186a0d2fd65", "539087be20f70186a0d51fe6", "539087be20f70186a0d52129", "5390a80f20f70186a0e974dd", "5390a96e20f70186a0ea2397", "5390a96e20f70186a0ea2e11", "5390aa0f20f70186a0ea8518", "539087c720f70186a0d56de9", "5390af8920f70186a0ed0710", "5390b36120f70186a0ef262a", "5390b56a20f70186a0f0491a", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0ba9d", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2875f", "558aca8d612c41e6b9d3a3c1", "558ce077612c5d355d05245a", "558fbf1b612c29c89cd7adb7", "539087eb20f70186a0d6a40d", "539087ef20f70186a0d6c98a", "539087ef20f70186a0d6d09b", "539087f320f70186a0d6f85e", "5390881720f70186a0d8053e", "5390881720f70186a0d805a9", "5390882420f70186a0d89093", "5390882c20f70186a0d8d832", "539088b820f70186a0d8f38f", "5390893e20f70186a0d93128", "539089ab20f70186a0d95ae6", "539089d220f70186a0d9a859", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa4f", "539089d220f70186a0d9abda", "53908a9620f70186a0da4703", "53908a9620f70186a0da4c55", "53908a9720f70186a0da5a2a", "5390879220f70186a0d3c62c", "53908b2a20f70186a0db93ea", "53908d6520f70186a0dd26d4", "539095ba20f70186a0df174b", "5390879920f70186a0d41e24"], "references": ["539098dc20f70186a0e0dabf", "539087f820f70186a0d72769", "539087f820f70186a0d7289a", "539087f820f70186a0d72ba9", "539087f820f70186a0d72c83", "539087f820f70186a0d72cd2", "539087f820f70186a0d72cc3", "5390880720f70186a0d7ab65", "5390880d20f70186a0d7b196", "5390880d20f70186a0d7b15f", "5390880d20f70186a0d7b22c", "5390893e20f70186a0d928e8", "5390893e20f70186a0d9398f", "5390893e20f70186a0d939a9", "53908a7420f70186a0da4654", "53908a7420f70186a0da4645", "53908b9320f70186a0dc1370", "539090c420f70186a0dddc7d", "539089ab20f70186a0d96ba4"], "authors": ["C.

Cartesian product files appear as a result of some secondary key access methods, such as the multiattribute hashing [10], the grid file [6] etc.. For the binary case, the problem is reduced into grouping the 2n binary strings on n bits in m groups of unsimilar strings. The main idea proposed in this paper is to group the strings such that the group forms an Error Correcting Code (ECC). This construction guarantees that the strings of a given group will have large Hamming distances, i.e., they will differ in many bit positions. Intuitively, this should result into good declustering. We briefly mention previous heuristics for declustering, we describe how exactly to build a declustering scheme using an ECC, and we prove a theorem that gives a necessary condition for our method to be optimal. Analytical results show that our method is superior to older heuristics, and that it is very close to the theoretical (non-tight) bound.", "year": "1989", "venue": "PODS '89 Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems", "citations": ["5390981d20f70186a0e049a7", "539087a120f70186a0d45380", "539099a220f70186a0e16d95", "539099b320f70186a0e19c9e", "539087a120f70186a0d45c17", "53909e8a20f70186a0e2d269", "53909ed120f70186a0e313f8", "539087ae20f70186a0d4dc04", "5390a6b120f70186a0e85b26", "5390b36120f70186a0ef2623", "539087ea20f70186a0d69b27", "539087ef20f70186a0d6e46d", "53908a9620f70186a0da49c0", "53908a9620f70186a0da4b99", "53908b2a20f70186a0db8f59", "53908cde20f70186a0dcde63", "539095bb20f70186a0df2608"], "references": ["539087f820f70186a0d72769", "539087f820f70186a0d72b6f", "539087f820f70186a0d72cc3", "539087f820f70186a0d72ed9", "5390880d20f70186a0d7b196", "5390878a20f70186a0d37321", "5390878a20f70186a0d37320", "53908a7420f70186a0da464e", "5390877920f70186a0d2db96", "5390877920f70186a0d2debc"], "authors": ["C.

Cartesian product files appear as a result of some secondary key access methods. For the binary case, the problem is reduced to grouping the 2/sup n/ binary strings on n bits in m groups of unsimilar strings. It is proposed that the strings be grouped such that these group forms an error correcting code (ECC). This construction guarantees that the strings of a given group will have large Hamming distances, i.e., they will differ in many bit positions. Intuitively, this should result in good declustering. The authors describe how to build a declustering scheme using an ECC, and prove a theorem that gives a necessary condition for the proposed method to be optimal. Analytical results show that the proposed method is superior to older heuristics, and that it is very close to the theoretical (nontight) bound.", "year": "1991", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Computers", "citations": ["5390b24420f70186a0ee7715", "539087d420f70186a0d5fd98", "539087e120f70186a0d65688", "5390881220f70186a0d7e8da", "539089ab20f70186a0d95399", "539089bb20f70186a0d97863", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa3a", "539089d220f70186a0d9aaac", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa97", "539089d320f70186a0d9b004", "53908a9620f70186a0da4afb", "53908a9620f70186a0da4c5b", "53908b2a20f70186a0db8cf5", "53908b4920f70186a0dbabd1", "53908b4920f70186a0dbccbc"], "references": ["5390877920f70186a0d2db96", "5390877920f70186a0d2debc", "5390878320f70186a0d32a49", "5390878a20f70186a0d37320", "5390878a20f70186a0d37321", "539087f820f70186a0d72769", "539087f820f70186a0d72b6f", "539087f820f70186a0d72cc3", "539087f820f70186a0d72ed9", "5390880d20f70186a0d7b196", "53908a7420f70186a0da465e", "53908a7420f70186a0da464e"], "authors": ["Christos Faloutsos", "Dimitris Metaxas"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a838c60b4bee2dec8fb0"}}, {"index": "539087a620f70186a0d4968c", "title": "Analysis of the clustering of Peano curves", "abstract": "", "year": "1991", "venue": "Analysis of the clustering of Peano curves", "citations": ["539089d220f70186a0d9aa4f", "539089d220f70186a0d9ab5c"], "references": [], "authors": ["Yi Rong", "Christos Faloutsos"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a896c60b4bee2df18394"}}, {"index": "539087a120f70186a0d45f62", "title": "Hybrid index organizations for text databases", "abstract": "", "year": "1991", "venue": "Hybrid index organizations for text databases", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["Christos Faloutsos", "H.

The R-tree code is identical to the one for a single-disk R-tree, with the only addition that we have to decide which disk a newly created R-tree node should be stored in. We propose and examine several criteria to choose a disk for a new node. The most successful one, termed \u201cproximity index\u201d or PI, estimates the similarity of the new node with the other R-tree nodes already on a disk, and chooses the disk with the lowest similarity. Experimental results show that our scheme consistently outperforms all the other heuristics for node-to-disk assignments, achieving up to 55% gains over the Round Robin one. Experiments also indicate that the multiplexed R-tree with PI heuristic gives better response time than the disk-stripping (=\u201cSuper-node\u201d) approach, and imposes lighter load on the I/O sub-system.The speed up of our method is close to linear speed up, increasing with the size of the queries.", "year": "1992", "venue": "SIGMOD '92 Proceedings of the 1992 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data", "citations": ["5390981d20f70186a0e05d07", "539099b320f70186a0e19c9e", "53909a9320f70186a0e21d12", "53909e8a20f70186a0e2cd52", "53909f2c20f70186a0e379d1", "539087a520f70186a0d48fdd", "5390a1d420f70186a0e58698", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e7444d", "539087be20f70186a0d51fe6", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea0816", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba2e4", "5390ad8920f70186a0ec0446", "5390ad8920f70186a0ec0467", "5390b29820f70186a0eeaed7", "5390b2d720f70186a0eec97a", "5390b36120f70186a0ef14ca", "5390b36120f70186a0ef241a", "5390b44620f70186a0ef9c08", "539087d420f70186a0d5de57", "539087d420f70186a0d5eea4", "5390b86b20f70186a0f29315", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3e25e", "5390bda020f70186a0f45ce0", "5390bda020f70186a0f47dac", "539087e120f70186a0d65688", "539087e720f70186a0d678f4", "539087e720f70186a0d69660", "539087eb20f70186a0d6a40d", "539087ef20f70186a0d6c264", "539087ef20f70186a0d6d09b", "539087f320f70186a0d6f792", "539087f820f70186a0d71e45", "539087fe20f70186a0d75269", "5390880720f70186a0d7a08b", "5390880720f70186a0d7a099", "5390881720f70186a0d805a9", "5390881820f70186a0d81c2e", "5390882420f70186a0d894eb", "5390893e20f70186a0d947fd", "539089ab20f70186a0d95399", "539089bb20f70186a0d97863", "539089d220f70186a0d9aaac", "539089d220f70186a0d9ab0f", "53908a5820f70186a0da1dfe", "53908a9620f70186a0da4b99", "53908a9620f70186a0da4ba3", "53908a9620f70186a0da4bb4", "53908adf20f70186a0dac255", "53908b2a20f70186a0db9e13", "53908b4920f70186a0dbaa1c", "539095ba20f70186a0df0c7f", "539095ba20f70186a0df0c81"], "references": ["5390879d20f70186a0d42d1b", "539087a120f70186a0d45be4", "539087a120f70186a0d45c17", "5390877f20f70186a0d2fd6e", "5390879220f70186a0d3c62c", "5390879220f70186a0d3d478", "5390879920f70186a0d41e24", "5390879920f70186a0d41e23", "5390879920f70186a0d42275", "539087a520f70186a0d48fdd", "539087f820f70186a0d7289a", "5390880720f70186a0d7aa91", "5390880d20f70186a0d7b22c", "539088b920f70186a0d9128c", "5390893e20f70186a0d928e8", "53908a9620f70186a0da4703", "53908a9620f70186a0da4908", "53908b9320f70186a0dc1370", "5390924920f70186a0de2b07", "539089ab20f70186a0d96ba4", "53908a7420f70186a0da464e"], "authors": ["Ibrahim Kamel", "Christos Faloutsos"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a587c60b4bede9eada60"}}, {"index": "539087a520f70186a0d48fdd", "title": "Parallel R-trees", "abstract": "We consider the problem of exploiting parallelism to accelerate the performance of spacial access methods and specifically, R-trees [11].

The R-tree code is identical to the one for a single-disk R-tree, with the only addition that we have to decide which disk a newly created R-tree node should be stored in. We propose and examine several criteria to choose a disk for a new node. The most successful one, termed \u201cproximity index\u201d or PI, estimates the similarity of the new node with the other R-tree nodes already on a disk, and chooses the disk with the lowest similarity. Experimental results show that our scheme consistently outperforms all the other heuristics for node-to-disk assignments, achieving up to 55% gains over the Round Robin one. Experiments also indicate that the multiplexed R-tree with PI heuristic gives better response time than the disk-stripping (=\u201cSuper-node\u201d) approach, and imposes lighter load on the I/O sub-system.The speed up of our method is close to linear speed up, increasing with the size of the queries.", "year": "1992", "venue": "SIGMOD '92 Proceedings of the 1992 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data", "citations": ["5390981d20f70186a0e05d07", "539099b320f70186a0e19c9e", "53909a9320f70186a0e21d12", "53909e8a20f70186a0e2cd52", "53909f2c20f70186a0e379d1", "539087a520f70186a0d48fdd", "5390a1d420f70186a0e58698", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e7444d", "539087be20f70186a0d51fe6", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea0816", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba2e4", "5390ad8920f70186a0ec0446", "5390ad8920f70186a0ec0467", "5390b29820f70186a0eeaed7", "5390b2d720f70186a0eec97a", "5390b36120f70186a0ef14ca", "5390b36120f70186a0ef241a", "5390b44620f70186a0ef9c08", "539087d420f70186a0d5de57", "539087d420f70186a0d5eea4", "5390b86b20f70186a0f29315", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3e25e", "5390bda020f70186a0f45ce0", "5390bda020f70186a0f47dac", "539087e120f70186a0d65688", "539087e720f70186a0d678f4", "539087e720f70186a0d69660", "539087eb20f70186a0d6a40d", "539087ef20f70186a0d6c264", "539087ef20f70186a0d6d09b", "539087f320f70186a0d6f792", "539087f820f70186a0d71e45", "539087fe20f70186a0d75269", "5390880720f70186a0d7a08b", "5390880720f70186a0d7a099", "5390881720f70186a0d805a9", "5390881820f70186a0d81c2e", "5390882420f70186a0d894eb", "5390893e20f70186a0d947fd", "539089ab20f70186a0d95399", "539089bb20f70186a0d97863", "539089d220f70186a0d9aaac", "539089d220f70186a0d9ab0f", "53908a5820f70186a0da1dfe", "53908a9620f70186a0da4b99", "53908a9620f70186a0da4ba3", "53908a9620f70186a0da4bb4", "53908adf20f70186a0dac255", "53908b2a20f70186a0db9e13", "53908b4920f70186a0dbaa1c", "539095ba20f70186a0df0c7f", "539095ba20f70186a0df0c81"], "references": ["5390879d20f70186a0d42d1b", "539087a120f70186a0d45be4", "539087a120f70186a0d45c17", "5390877f20f70186a0d2fd6e", "5390879220f70186a0d3c62c", "5390879220f70186a0d3d478", "5390879920f70186a0d41e24", "5390879920f70186a0d41e23", "5390879920f70186a0d42275", "539087a520f70186a0d48fdd", "539087f820f70186a0d7289a", "5390880720f70186a0d7aa91", "5390880d20f70186a0d7b22c", "539088b920f70186a0d9128c", "5390893e20f70186a0d928e8", "53908a9620f70186a0da4703", "53908a9620f70186a0da4908", "53908b9320f70186a0dc1370", "5390924920f70186a0de2b07", "539089ab20f70186a0d96ba4", "53908a7420f70186a0da464e"], "authors": ["Ibrahim Kamel", "Christos Faloutsos"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a659c60b4bee2dd63273"}}, {"index": "53908a4020f70186a0d9f2ab", "title": "Hybrid Index Organizations for Text Databases", "abstract": "", "year": "1992", "venue": "EDBT '92 Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology", "citations": ["5390995d20f70186a0e15cb0", "539087b320f70186a0d4efc9", "5390a79f20f70186a0e9230d", "539087c320f70186a0d561d3", "539087c720f70186a0d56df7", "5390b5c620f70186a0f07d7b", "5390b9d520f70186a0f3008e", "539087d920f70186a0d62201", "539087e720f70186a0d69b02", "539087f320f70186a0d6f7b0", "5390881220f70186a0d7e29a", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa2c", "53908a9620f70186a0da4a5a", "53908a9620f70186a0da4c45", "53908b2a20f70186a0db81fa", "53908b4920f70186a0dbabb9", "53908cde20f70186a0dce21c"], "references": [], "authors": ["Christos Faloutsos", "H.

The generalized version of the method is shown to be a unified framework for several popular signature file methods including the sequential signature file (SSF) method, bit-sliced signature file (BSSF) method, and its enhanced version of B'SSF.

files on M units. The focus is on range queries, as opposed to partial match queries that older declustering methods have examined. Our method uses a distance-preserving mapping, namely, the Hilbert curve, to impose a linear ordering on the multidimensional points (buckets); then, it traverses the buckets according to this ordering, assigning buckets to disks in a round-robin fashion. Thanks to the good distance-preserving properties of the Hilbert curve, the end result is that each disk contains buckets that are far away in the K-d address space. This is exactly the goal of declustering. Experiments show that these intuitive arguments lead indeed to good performance: the proposed method performs at least as well or better than older declustering schemes.", "year": "1993", "venue": "PDIS '93 Proceedings of the second international conference on Parallel and distributed information systems", "citations": ["5390975920f70186a0dfc97f", "5390979920f70186a0dffd7d", "5390979920f70186a0e0139f", "5390980720f70186a0e03743", "5390980720f70186a0e037e8", "5390981d20f70186a0e049a7", "5390981d20f70186a0e05d06", "539098b820f70186a0e0bcbc", "539099a220f70186a0e16d96", "539099a220f70186a0e16d95", "539099b320f70186a0e19c9e", "539099ec20f70186a0e1d375", "53909e8a20f70186a0e2cd52", "53909e8a20f70186a0e2d269", "5390a54620f70186a0e77153", "5390a6b120f70186a0e85b26", "539087c720f70186a0d56f80", "5390af8920f70186a0ed0710", "5390b24420f70186a0ee7715", "5390b29820f70186a0eeafc9", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3dc5a", "539087e120f70186a0d65688", "539087e120f70186a0d662f7", "539087e720f70186a0d69659", "539087ea20f70186a0d69b27", "539087f320f70186a0d6efb2", "539087f820f70186a0d72c96", "539087fe20f70186a0d751c3", "539087fe20f70186a0d75e4c", "5390881220f70186a0d7e8da", "5390882420f70186a0d89093", "5390882420f70186a0d894eb", "539089ab20f70186a0d95399", "539089ab20f70186a0d97453", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa97", "539089d220f70186a0d9ab45", "53908a5820f70186a0da0c1e", "53908a5820f70186a0da1dfe", "53908a7420f70186a0da2138", "53908a9620f70186a0da4c5b", "53908b2a20f70186a0db8cf5", "53908b2a20f70186a0db8f59", "53908b2a20f70186a0db93e6", "53908b4920f70186a0dbabe3", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc875", "53908b4920f70186a0dbccbc", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbd7f2", "53908bfb20f70186a0dcb4ce", "53908cde20f70186a0dcde63", "539095ba20f70186a0df15f7", "539095ba20f70186a0df174b"], "references": [], "authors": ["Christos Faloutsos", "Pravin Bhagwat"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a71ac60b4bee2ddf28ab"}}, {"index": "53908b2a20f70186a0db9697", "title": "Declustering Using Fractals", "abstract": "", "year": "1993", "venue": "PDIS '93 Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Information Systems", "citations": ["539089bb20f70186a0d97863", "53908a9620f70186a0da4afb"], "references": [], "authors": ["Christos Faloutsos", "Pravin Bhagwat"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a736c60b4bee2de07399"}}, {"index": "539087c320f70186a0d54545", "title": "Fast subsequence matching in time-series databases", "abstract": "", "year": "1993", "venue": "Fast subsequence matching in time-series databases", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["Christos Faloutsos", "M.

The idea is to map each data sequences into a small set of multidimensional rectangles in feature space. Then, these rectangles can be readily indexed using traditional spatial access methods, like the R*-tree [9]. In more detail, we use a sliding window over the data sequence and extract its features; the result is a trail in feature space. We propose an efficient and effective algorithm to divide such trails into sub-trails, which are subsequently represented by their Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs). We also examine queries of varying lengths, and we show how to handle each case efficiently. We implemented our method and carried out experiments on synthetic and real data (stock price movements). We compared the method to sequential scanning, which is the only obvious competitor. The results were excellent: our method accelerated the search time from 3 times up to 100 times.", "year": "1994", "venue": "SIGMOD '94 Proceedings of the 1994 ACM SIGMOD international conference on

The idea is to use only a few of the features, using additional features only when the additional discriminatory power is absolutely necessary. We present in detail the design of our tree structure and the associated algorithms that handle such \"varying length\" feature vectors. Finally, we report simulation results, comparing the proposed structure with the R*-tree, which is one of the most successful methods for low-dimensionality spaces. The results illustrate the superiority of our method, which saves up to 80% in disk accesses.", "year": "1994", "venue": "The VLDB Journal \u2014 The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases -

Using measurements on real data sets (road intersections of U.S. counties, star coordinates from NASA's Infrared-Ultraviolet Explorer etc.) we provide evidence that real data indeed are skewed, and, moreover, we show that they behave as mathematical fractals, with a measurable, non-integer fractal dimension.Armed with this tool, we then show its practical use in predicting the performance of spatial access methods, and specifically of the R-trees. We provide the first analysis of R-trees for skewed distributions of points: We develop a formula that estimates the number of disk accesses for range queries, given only the fractal dimension of the point set, and its count. Experiments on real data sets show that the formula is very accurate: the relative error is usually below 5%, and it rarely exceeds 10%.We believe that the fractal dimension will help replace the uniformity and independence assumptions, allowing more accurate analysis for any spatial access method, as well as better estimates for query optimization on multi-attribute queries.", "year": "1994", "venue": "PODS '94 Proceedings of the thirteenth ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems", "citations": ["5390972920f70186a0dfb17d", "5390975920f70186a0dfccb1", "5390979920f70186a0dffe5e", "5390981d20f70186a0e050e6", "5390981d20f70186a0e05d35", "539098b820f70186a0e0a836", "539098dc20f70186a0e0d08b", "539099a220f70186a0e17bc1", "539099a220f70186a0e17ce4", "539099a220f70186a0e17d7a", "539099a220f70186a0e1800e", "539099a220f70186a0e18143", "539099b320f70186a0e1b7e8", "53909ce520f70186a0e27f30", "53909ed120f70186a0e30a7b", "53909eef20f70186a0e358ab", "53909f6a20f70186a0e3b750", "53909fca20f70186a0e46091", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e55765", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d8a5", "5390a25820f70186a0e5e89c", "5390a2e920f70186a0e676c1", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e745a0", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75a02", "5390a54620f70186a0e773f4", "5390a55520f70186a0e79617", "5390a80f20f70186a0e9758b", "5390aa0f20f70186a0ea8512", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebb897", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecbd58", "5390afc920f70186a0ed21b1", "5390b29820f70186a0ee95af", "5390b2fc20f70186a0eedfec", "539087cf20f70186a0d5c963", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0b3fd", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff79", "539087d920f70186a0d60749", "539087d920f70186a0d60e40", "539087d920f70186a0d60e54", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c6de", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d244", "558adf5a612c41e6b9d3bfb3", "539087e120f70186a0d65688", "539087e120f70186a0d66911", "558b0503612c41e6b9d4082b", "539087e720f70186a0d67861", "539087e720f70186a0d6934d", "539087e720f70186a0d6934e", "539087e720f70186a0d6934c", "539087e720f70186a0d69660", "539087e720f70186a0d69afe", "539087eb20f70186a0d6a0c0", "539087eb20f70186a0d6a40d", "539087ef20f70186a0d6c236", "539087ef20f70186a0d6d09b", "539087f820f70186a0d71f36", "5390880220f70186a0d75efd", "5390880720f70186a0d7a76c", "5390880d20f70186a0d7d16a", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2f1", "5390881220f70186a0d7e314", "5390881720f70186a0d805a9", "5390881720f70186a0d805a8", "5390881720f70186a0d80be5", "5390882d20f70186a0d8dac2", "539088b820f70186a0d8f38f", "539089ab20f70186a0d95394", "539089ab20f70186a0d95399", "539089ab20f70186a0d953e3", "539089ab20f70186a0d95ae6", "539089ab20f70186a0d95b49", "539089d220f70186a0d9ab16", "539089d220f70186a0d9ab5b", "539089d220f70186a0d9ab94", "539089d220f70186a0d9abb1", "53908a4020f70186a0d9dc94", "53908a4020f70186a0d9f39d", "53908a4020f70186a0d9f3a8", "53908a5720f70186a0da0b80", "53908a5720f70186a0da0b93", "53908a7420f70186a0da453f", "53908a7420f70186a0da45ca", "53908a9620f70186a0da47d6", "53908a9620f70186a0da4ce5", "53908a9620f70186a0da4dc3", "53908a9620f70186a0da4cfa", "53908a9620f70186a0da4e3b", "53908ac620f70186a0daa3dd", "53908adf20f70186a0dabdd7", "53908af920f70186a0daff13", "53908b2a20f70186a0db914e", "53908b2a20f70186a0db945f", "53908b9320f70186a0dc015b", "5390958920f70186a0dee019", "539095ba20f70186a0df0953", "539095ba20f70186a0df0c81", "5390962020f70186a0df4c99", "5390962020f70186a0df4cb3"], "references": ["539087a120f70186a0d45bfd", "539087ae20f70186a0d4e51c", "5390877f20f70186a0d2fd6e", "539087be20f70186a0d52129", "5390878720f70186a0d34b0e", "5390878a20f70186a0d37318", "5390879220f70186a0d3d476", "5390879220f70186a0d3d478", "5390879920f70186a0d41e23", "539087f820f70186a0d72761", "539087f820f70186a0d7289a", "539087f820f70186a0d72769", "5390880720f70186a0d7aa91", "53908a5720f70186a0da0688", "53908a9620f70186a0da4703", "53908a9620f70186a0da4908", "53908a9620f70186a0da4a5a", "53908b2a20f70186a0db949e", "539089ab20f70186a0d96ba4"], "authors": ["Christos Faloutsos", "Ibrahim Kamel"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a8b9c60b4bee2df35679"}}, {"index": "539087c720f70186a0d56e3e", "title": "Quest: a project on database mining", "abstract": "", "year": "1994", "venue": "SIGMOD '94 Proceedings of the 1994 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data", "citations": ["5390b36120f70186a0ef0ed6", "5390b36120f70186a0ef264d", "53908b4920f70186a0dbabca"], "references": ["539087be20f70186a0d51fe3", "53908a4020f70186a0d9dc6b", "53908a5720f70186a0d9fbd9", "53908a9620f70186a0da4a52"], "authors": ["R.

Thus, we can subsequently use highly fine-tuned spatial access methods (SAMs), to answer several types of queries, including the 'Query By Example' type (which translates to a range query); the 'all pairs' query (which translates to a spatial join [8]); the nearest-neighbor or best-match query, etc.However, designing feature extraction functions can be hard. It is relatively easier for a domain expert to assess the similarity/distance of two objects. Given only the distance information though, it is not obvious how to map objects into points.This is exactly the topic of this paper. We describe a fast algorithm to map objects into points in some k-dimensional space (k is user-defined), such that the dis-similarities are preserved. There are two benefits from this mapping: (a) efficient retrieval, in conjunction with a SAM, as discussed before and (b) visualization and data-mining: the objects can now be plotted as points in 2-d or 3-d space, revealing potential clusters, correlations among attributes and other regularities that data-mining is looking for.We introduce an older method from pattern recognition, namely, Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) [51]; although unsuitable for indexing, we use it as yardstick for our method. Then, we propose a much faster algorithm to solve the problem in hand, while in addition it allows for indexing. Experiments on real and synthetic data indeed show that the proposed algorithm is significantly faster than MDS, (being linear, as opposed to quadratic, on the database size N), while it manages to preserve distances and the overall structure of the data-set.", "year": "1995", "venue": "SIGMOD '95 Proceedings of the 1995 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data", "citations":

Previous works on buffer allocation are based either exclusively on the availability of buffers at runtime or on the access patterns of queries. In this paper, we first propose a unified approach for buffer allocation in which both of these considerations are taken into account. Our approach is based on the notion of marginal gains which specify the expected reduction in page faults by allocating extra buffers to a query. Then, we extend this approach to support adaptable buffer allocation. An adaptable buffer allocation algorithm automatically optimizes itself for the specific query workload. To achieve this adaptability, we propose using run-time information, such as the load of the system, in buffer allocation decisions. Our approach is to use a simple queuing model to predict whether a buffer allocation will improve the performance of the system. Thus, this paper provides a more theoretical basis for buffer allocation. Simulation results show that our methods based on marginal gains and our predictive methods consistently outperform existing allocation strategies. In addition, the predictive methods have the added advantage of adjusting their allocation to changing workloads.", "year": "1995", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Computers", "citations": ["53909ee020f70186a0e32bba", "53909ee020f70186a0e32b8f", "53909ee020f70186a0e32c72", "53909eef20f70186a0e36aef", "5390a01420f70186a0e477b2", "5390a2e920f70186a0e67714", "5390a8dc20f70186a0e9e962", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1457", "558afab9612c41e6b9d3f5f7", "539087ef20f70186a0d6c221", "539087f320f70186a0d6ee76", "5390880220f70186a0d76d1c", "539089d220f70186a0d9a831", "539089d220f70186a0d9a822", "53908b2a20f70186a0db9745", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbd5dc", "53908e0020f70186a0dd54de"], "references": ["539087a120f70186a0d45c12", "5390877920f70186a0d2cd5c", "539087f820f70186a0d72761", "539087f820f70186a0d72e2d", "539087f820f70186a0d72e3e", "539087f820f70186a0d72e94", "5390880c20f70186a0d7acee", "5390880d20f70186a0d7b15f", "5390882420f70186a0d88072", "5390877920f70186a0d2dcc8", "5390879520f70186a0d3fb06", "53908a9620f70186a0da4905", "53908a9620f70186a0da4ea4"], "authors": ["Raymond Ng", "Christos Faloutsos", "Timos Sellis"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a8ccc60b4bee2df4484c"}}, {"index": "539087d420f70186a0d5dbee", "title": "A survey of information retrieval and filtering methods", "abstract": "", "year": "1995", "venue": "A survey of information retrieval and filtering methods", "citations": ["5390975920f70186a0dfe560", "5390980720f70186a0e01da3", "539098b820f70186a0e0af13", "5390995d20f70186a0e1578c", "5390995d20f70186a0e15cb0", "53909ed120f70186a0e306c8", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4ae9a", "5390a30b20f70186a0e69b85", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f6f9", "5390a74f20f70186a0e8cbba", "5390a88c20f70186a0e99e42", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea0c92", "5390b29820f70186a0ee909b", "5390b29820f70186a0ee99cc", "5390b2fc20f70186a0eefb2c", "5390b48420f70186a0efa905", "5390b4c320f70186a0efd63e", "539087e120f70186a0d657bd", "558bd0f40cf25dbdbb04dc1c", "539087e720f70186a0d69358", "539087ef20f70186a0d6ca8e", "539087f820f70186a0d71593", "539087f820f70186a0d71873", "539087f820f70186a0d719e3", "5390880720f70186a0d79ef6", "5390880720f70186a0d7ab2f", "5390881220f70186a0d7f6ca", "5390881720f70186a0d805d9", "5390893e20f70186a0d92858", "5390893e20f70186a0d93628", "539089ab20f70186a0d96e6b", "539089ab20f70186a0d9739a", "539089d320f70186a0d9b311", "53908a7420f70186a0da4570", "53908a7420f70186a0da4683", "53908a9620f70186a0da4ee7", "53908a9620f70186a0da599c", "53908a9720f70186a0da5d52", "53908a9720f70186a0da6cb8", "53908b4920f70186a0dba8e6", "53908b4920f70186a0dbabd8", "53908b4920f70186a0dbbc59", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc89d", "53908d6520f70186a0dd194e", "539095ba20f70186a0df0eed", "539095bb20f70186a0df268b"], "references": [], "authors": ["Christos Faloutsos", "Douglas W.

Our formula includes as special cases the formulae of previous efforts for two-dimensional spaces [8]. It also agrees with theoretical and empirical results that the number of blocks depends on the hypersurface of the hyperrectangle and not on its hypervolume. The practical use of the derived formula is that it allows the estimation of the space requirements of the n-dimensional quadtree decomposition. Quadtrees are used extensively in two-dimensional spaces (geographic information systems and spatial databases in general), as well in higher dimensionality spaces (as oct-trees for three-dimensional spaces, e.g., in graphics, robotics, and three-dimensional medical images [2]). Our formula permits the estimation of the space requirements for data hyperrectangles when stored in an index structure like a (n-dimensional) quadtree, as well as the estimation of the search time for query hyperrectangles, for the so-called linear quadtrees [17]. A theoretical contribution of the paper is the observation that the number of blocks is a piece-wise linear function of the sides of the hyperrectangle.", "year": "1997", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "citations": ["5390979920f70186a0dffd75", "5390995d20f70186a0e15789", "53909a9320f70186a0e21a6e", "5390a01420f70186a0e4772d", "5390a05a20f70186a0e49fcf", "5390afc920f70186a0ed2a5c", "5390b24420f70186a0ee7900", "5390be6620f70186a0f4cbca", "539087f320f70186a0d6f85e", "5390881220f70186a0d7d72e", "539089bb20f70186a0d979a4", "539089d220f70186a0d9ab5c", "53908a9620f70186a0da4e3b", "53908a9720f70186a0da622a", "53908af920f70186a0daff94", "5390962020f70186a0df3a44"], "references": ["539087a120f70186a0d45be4", "539087a620f70186a0d4968c", "539087a620f70186a0d49842", "5390877f20f70186a0d2fd6e", "5390880d20f70186a0d7b22c", "5390878a20f70186a0d36ee8", "5390878a20f70186a0d37d43", "539088b920f70186a0d9128c", "5390879220f70186a0d3c62c", "5390879920f70186a0d41e24", "539089d320f70186a0d9b45c", "53908a5720f70186a0da0407", "53908a5720f70186a0da0688", "53908a9620f70186a0da4908", "53908b2a20f70186a0db949e"], "authors": ["Christos Faloutsos", "H. v.

While compression can be used to decrease the size of the dataset, compressed data is notoriously difficult to index or access.In this paper we consider a very large dataset comprising multiple distinct time sequences. Each point in the sequence is a numerical value. We show how to compress such a dataset into a format that supports ad hoc querying, provided that a small error can be tolerated when the data is uncompressed. Experiments on large, real world datasets (AT&T customer calling patterns) show that the proposed method achieves an average of less than 5% error in any data value after compressing to a mere 2.5% of the original space (i.e., a 40:1 compression ratio), with these numbers not very sensitive to dataset size.

Image content is represented by attributed relational graphs holding features of objects and relationships between objects. The method relies on the assumption that a fixed number of \"labeled\" or \"expected\" objects (e.g., \"heart,\" \"lungs,\" etc.) are common in all images of a given application domain in addition to a variable number of \"unexpected\" or \"unlabeled\" objects (e.g., \"tumor,\" \"hematoma,\" etc.). The method can answer queries by example, such as \"find all X-rays that are similar to Smith's X-ray.\" The stored images are mapped to points in a multidimensional space and are indexed using state-of-the-art database methods (R-trees). The proposed method has several desirable properties:Database search is approximate, so that all images up to a prespecified degree of similarity (tolerance) are retrieved.It has no \"false dismissals\" (i.e., all images qualifying query selection criteria are retrieved).It is much faster than sequential scanning for searching in the main memory and on the disk (i.e., by up to an order of magnitude), thus scaling-up well for large databases.", "year": "1997", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "citations": ["5390972920f70186a0dfaca3", "5390975920f70186a0dfcca8", "5390975920f70186a0dfccb2", "5390979920f70186a0dfed37", "5390985d20f70186a0e06e87", "5390994d20f70186a0e11c57", "5390995d20f70186a0e15fd6", "539099a220f70186a0e1709d", "539099a220f70186a0e177b0", "539099b320f70186a0e1b7e6", "53909a9320f70186a0e2202e", "53909e8a20f70186a0e2ce25", "53909e8a20f70186a0e2d5cd", "53909fbd20f70186a0e41c3f", "53909fca20f70186a0e455d3", "5390a01420f70186a0e46829", "5390a01420f70186a0e47778", "5390a01420f70186a0e47770", "5390a25820f70186a0e5eba0", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f725", "5390a63c20f70186a0e81562", "5390a6d920f70186a0e887d5", "5390a72220f70186a0e8a925", "5390a79f20f70186a0e922f3", "5390a8db20f70186a0e9d9bf", "5390a8dc20f70186a0e9ec4c", "5390a8dc20f70186a0e9efb3", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea00b9", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea66b8", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea77a5", "5390aa7620f70186a0eaa95b", "5390ac5720f70186a0eb7105", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec5267", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec8a2f", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec8d04", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed59c1", "5390b19020f70186a0edf380", "5390b19020f70186a0edfd9b", "5390b24320f70186a0ee6595", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1adf", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef42b8", "5390b4c320f70186a0efd876", "5390b5c620f70186a0f07d6d", "5390b5c620f70186a0f08dc2", "5390b5ed20f70186a0f0d94c", "5390880220f70186a0d75ff6", "5390880220f70186a0d7820c", "5390880720f70186a0d7a7be", "5390880d20f70186a0d7c5fe", "5390881220f70186a0d7d6a1", "5390881220f70186a0d7d72e", "5390881720f70186a0d803f1", "5390881720f70186a0d80c62", "5390881820f70186a0d81175", "5390882d20f70186a0d8dcc6", "5390882d20f70186a0d8e068", "539089ab20f70186a0d95ae8", "539089d220f70186a0d9ab99", "539089d220f70186a0d9abe0", "53908a4020f70186a0d9f408", "53908a7420f70186a0da2837", "53908a7420f70186a0da4522", "53908a9620f70186a0da4e86", "53908ae020f70186a0dade05", "53908b4920f70186a0dbabc1", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbd1ac", "5390958a20f70186a0deff9d", "539095bb20f70186a0df265c"], "references": ["539087a120f70186a0d45bf1", "539087aa20f70186a0d4b096", "539087aa20f70186a0d4b185", "539087be20f70186a0d5164a", "5390877f20f70186a0d2fd6e", "539087c320f70186a0d5534b", "539087c320f70186a0d56251", "539087c720f70186a0d56de9", "539087d420f70186a0d5df11", "5390878320f70186a0d3283b", "539087f820f70186a0d7289a", "5390880d20f70186a0d7b22c", "539088b920f70186a0d9128c", "539089ab20f70186a0d96ba4", "5390878e20f70186a0d39d70", "539089d220f70186a0d9a921", "5390877920f70186a0d2e513", "5390879220f70186a0d3c62c", "5390879220f70186a0d3d72a", "5390879520f70186a0d3fc20", "5390879920f70186a0d41277", "5390879920f70186a0d41e24", "5390879920f70186a0d41e23", "53908a4020f70186a0d9dc51", "53908a9620f70186a0da4703", "53908a9620f70186a0da4a5c", "53908a9620f70186a0da4c55"], "authors": ["Euripides G.

In this paper, we examine the issues involved in designing efficient access methods for bitemporal databases, and propose the partial-persistence and the double-tree methodologies. The partial-persistence methodology reduces bitemporal queries to partial persistence problems for which an efficient access method is then designed. The double-tree methodology \"sees\" each bitemporal data object as consisting of two intervals (a valid-time and a transaction-time interval) and divides objects into two categories according to whether the right endpoint of the transaction time interval is already known. A common characteristic of both methodologies is that they take into account the properties of each time dimension.

In this article, we examine the problem of selectivity estimation for some types of spatial queries in databases containing real data. We have shown earlier [Faloutsos and Kamel 1994] that real point sets typically have a nonuniform distribution, violating consistently the uniformity and independence assumptions. Moreover, we demonstrated that the theory of fractals can help to describe real point sets. In this article we show how the concept of fractal dimension, i.e., (noninteger) dimension, can lead to the solution for the selectivity estimation problem in spatial databases. Among the infinite family of fractal dimensions, we consider here the Hausdorff fractal dimension D0 and the \u201cCorrelation\u201d fractal dimension D2. Specifically, we show that (a) the average number of neighbors for a given point set follows a power law, with D2 as exponent, and (b) the average number of nonempty range queries follows a power law with E \u2212 D0 as exponent (E is the dimension of the embedding space). We present the formulas to estimate the selectivity for \u201cbiased\u201d range queries, for self-spatial joins, and for the average number of nonempty range queries. The result of some experiments on real and synthetic point sets are shown.

This color clustering produces for each image a small set of representative colors which captures the color properties of the image, and a small set of sizable contiguous regions which captures the spatial/geometrical properties of the image. The proposed method outperforms the traditional histogram and its improved methods not only with its richer image retrieval capabilities which cover a wider spectrum of user requirements, but also with its powerful indexing scheme which is essential to cater for large scale image databases.", "year": "1998", "venue": "CVPR '98 Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "citations": ["5390972920f70186a0dfa624", "5390980720f70186a0e0257c", "5390af8920f70186a0ecf74b", "5390b2d720f70186a0eec3d9", "5390ba3820f70186a0f3529d", "539089ab20f70186a0d95b6d", "539089bb20f70186a0d9962c", "53908b2a20f70186a0db81d4", "53908b2a20f70186a0db8338", "5390958920f70186a0dee371", "5390962020f70186a0df459d"], "references": ["539087dd20f70186a0d644e0", "53908b9320f70186a0dc0091", "53908b9320f70186a0dc0093", "53908bde20f70186a0dc76c4"], "authors": ["Y.

These power-laws hold for three snapshots of the Internet, between November 1997 and December 1998, despite a 45% growth of its size during that period. We show that our power-laws fit the real data very well resulting in correlation coefficients of 96% or higher.Our observations provide a novel perspective of the structure of the Internet. The power-laws describe concisely skewed distributions of graph properties such as the node outdegree. In addition, these power-laws can be used to estimate important parameters such as the average neighborhood size, and facilitate the design and the performance analysis of protocols. Furthermore, we can use them to generate and select realistic topologies for simulation purposes.", "year": "1999", "venue": "Proceedings of the conference on Applications, technologies,

After performing the Slim-down algorithm, we observed improvements up to a factor of 35% for range queries.", "year": "2000", "venue": "EDBT '00 Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Extending Database Technology: Advances in Database Technology", "citations": ["5390a1bc20f70186a0e55ba3", "5390a1d420f70186a0e58680", "5390a88c20f70186a0e99394", "5390aca820f70186a0eb87e1", "5390aca820f70186a0eb87e3", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebb30f", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebdcb6", "5390ad8920f70186a0ec0467", "5390aefc20f70186a0ecdcd0", "5390aefc20f70186a0ecdcd5", "5390af8920f70186a0ecfd39", "5390b13020f70186a0ede120", "5390b36120f70186a0ef0d50", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef5dfe", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef6f35", "5390b78a20f70186a0f2427f", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f32d8b", "5390bda020f70186a0f462ac", "5390bda020f70186a0f46e64", "558b3e5d612c41e6b9d476cb", "53908a9720f70186a0da5a2a", "53908ac620f70186a0daa972"], "references": ["539087c320f70186a0d54c85", "539087dd20f70186a0d644de", "539087e120f70186a0d66900", "539087eb20f70186a0d6a40d", "539087f820f70186a0d71713", "5390880d20f70186a0d7b582", "539089ab20f70186a0d96ba4", "539089bb20f70186a0d9940b", "5390879920f70186a0d41e23", "53908a7420f70186a0da4484", "53908a9620f70186a0da4703", "53908a9620f70186a0da4c5a", "53908b1820f70186a0db490f"], "authors": ["Caetano Traina", "Jr.", "Agma J.

Uniform random sampling is frequently used in practice and also frequently criticized because it will miss small clusters. Many natural phenomena are known to follow Zipf's distribution and the inability of uniform sampling to find small clusters is of practical concern. Density Biased Sampling is proposed to probabilistically under-sample dense regions and over-sample light regions. A weighted sample is used to preserve the densities of the original data. Density biased sampling naturally includes uniform sampling as a special case. A memory efficient algorithm is proposed that approximates density biased sampling using only a single scan of the data. We empirically evaluate density biased sampling using synthetic data sets that exhibit varying cluster size distributions finding up to a factor of six improvement over uniform sampling.", "year": "2000", "venue": "SIGMOD '00 Proceedings of the 2000 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data", "citations": ["5390972920f70186a0dfad19", "5390975920f70186a0dfdb4c", "5390979920f70186a0e00fe5", "5390980720f70186a0e02c8e", "539098dc20f70186a0e0ce71", "539099a220f70186a0e17bc2", "539099a220f70186a0e1917d", "53909a9320f70186a0e23ca3", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2e3bd", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2f032", "53909eef20f70186a0e3589e", "53909f6a20f70186a0e3bbbd", "5390a01420f70186a0e48716", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4a550", "5390a1d420f70186a0e569a6", "5390a1e620f70186a0e596dc", "5390a25820f70186a0e5f0e9", "5390a2e920f70186a0e67a2c", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e759b4", "5390a79f20f70186a0e922fc", "5390a8dc20f70186a0e9efb0", "5390a96f20f70186a0ea41e6", "5390aa7620f70186a0eaa56d", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe3e1", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecb28c", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecbd68", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3f4f", "5390b24320f70186a0ee6cce", "5390b29820f70186a0ee9ddb", "5390b36120f70186a0ef2660", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef4afc", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef6878", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef6f26", "5390b48420f70186a0efa7f6", "5390b9d520f70186a0f31d62", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f34c05", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d308", "5390bda020f70186a0f46c34", "5390be6620f70186a0f4beeb", "55323bec45cec66b6f9dae11", "5390881720f70186a0d8053c", "5390893e20f70186a0d93055", "539089bb20f70186a0d979a1", "53908a9620f70186a0da49d2", "53908aac20f70186a0da8111", "53908b4920f70186a0dbbf88", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc3a4", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc417", "5390958920f70186a0dee374", "5390958a20f70186a0defdea", "539095ba20f70186a0df0953", "539095ba20f70186a0df0ebd"], "references": ["539087a520f70186a0d48d93", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff7a", "539087dd20f70186a0d644a8", "539087e720f70186a0d69653", "539087e720f70186a0d69669", "539087ef20f70186a0d6ca1a", "5390877920f70186a0d2cfb0", "5390877920f70186a0d2d9ad", "5390879920f70186a0d41e28", "5390882420f70186a0d884d9", "5390882420f70186a0d88847", "53908a9620f70186a0da4a5a", "53908a9620f70186a0da4d9c", "53908a9620f70186a0da4d7b"], "authors": ["Christopher R.

We will show that real region datasets are packed in an R-tree into minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) whose area distribution follows the same power law, named REGAL (REGion Area Law), as that for the regions themselves. Moreover, these MBRs are packed in their turn into MBRs following the same law, and so on iteratively, up to the root of the R-tree. Based on this observation, we are able to accurately estimate the search effort for range queries, using a small number of easy-to-retrieve parameters. Furthermore, since our analysis exploits, through a realistic mathematical model, the proximity relations existing among the regions in the dataset, we show how to use our model to predict the selectivity of a self-spatial join query posed on the dataset. Experiments on a variety of real datasets (islands, lakes, human-inhabited areas) show that our estimations are accurate, enjoying a geometric average relative error ranging from 22 percent to 32 percent for the search effort of a range query, and from 14 percent to 34 percent for the selectivity of a self-spatial join query. This is significantly better than using a naive model based on uniformity assumption, which gives rise to a geometric average relative error up to 270 percent and up to 85 percent for the two

Due to the pair-count exponent and our analysis (Law 1), we can achieve accurate selectivity estimates in constant time (O(1)) without the need for sampling or other expensive operations.

We propose a new paradigm, namely, Ratio Rules, which are quantifiable in that we can measure the \u201cgoodness\u201d of a set of discovered rules. We also propose the \u201cguessing error\u201d as a measure of the \u201cgoodness\u201d, that is, the root-mean-square error of the reconstructed values of the cells of the given matrix, when we pretend that they are unknown. Another contribution is a novel method to guess missing/hidden values from the Ratio Rules that our method derives. For example, if somebody bought $10 of milk and $3 of bread, our rules can \u201cguess\u201d the amount spent on butter. Thus, unlike association rules, Ratio Rules can perform a variety of important tasks such as forecasting, answering \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenarios, detecting outliers, and visualizing the data. Moreover, we show that we can compute Ratio Rules in a single pass over the data set with small memory requirements (a few small matrices), in contrast to association rule mining methods which require multiple passes and/or large memory. Experiments on several real data sets (e.g., basketball and baseball statistics, biological data) demonstrate that the proposed method: (a) leads to rules that make sense; (b) can find large itemsets in binary matrices, even in the presence of noise; and (c) consistently achieves a \u201cguessing error\u201d of up to 5 times less than using straightforward column averages.", "year": "2000", "venue": "The VLDB Journal \u2014 The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases", "citations": ["5390995d20f70186a0e159dc", "539099b320f70186a0e19a2c", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a513", "5390a17720f70186a0e53c1d", "5390a25820f70186a0e5f58e", "5390a45520f70186a0e71b40", "5390a80f20f70186a0e96ae6", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebc3c3", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda0a0", "5390b20120f70186a0ee4181", "5390881720f70186a0d8021b", "53908b2a20f70186a0db8ebe", "53908b4920f70186a0dba83e"], "references": [], "authors": ["Flip Korn", "Alexandros Labrinidis", "Yannis Kotidis", "Christos Faloutsos"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a7ecc60b4bee2de895ff"}}, {"index": "5390880220f70186a0d75ed8", "title": "Data mining on an OLTP system (nearly) for free", "abstract": "This paper proposes a scheme for scheduling disk requests that takes advantage of the ability of high-level functions to operate directly at individual disk drives. We show that such a scheme makes it possible to support a Data Mining workload on an OLTP system almost for free: there is only a small impact on the throughput and response time of the existing workload. Specifically, we show that an OLTP system has the disk resources to consistently provide one third of its sequential bandwidth to a background Data Mining task with close to zero impact on OLTP throughput and response time at high transaction loads. At low transaction loads, we show much lower impact than observed in previous work. This means that a production OLTP system can be used for Data Mining tasks without the expense of a second dedicated system. Our scheme takes advantage of close interaction with the on-disk scheduler by reading blocks for the Data Mining workload as the disk head \u201cpasses over\u201d them while satisfying demand blocks from the OLTP request stream. We show that this scheme provides a consistent level of throughput for the background workload even at very high foreground loads. Such a scheme is of most benefit in combination with an Active Disk environment that allows the background Data Mining application to also take advantage of the processing power and memory available directly on the disk drives.", "year": "2000", "venue": "SIGMOD '00 Proceedings of the 2000 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data", "citations": ["5390975920f70186a0dfe097", "539098b820f70186a0e0ae74", "539098dc20f70186a0e0c70f", "539099ec20f70186a0e1d97c", "53909e8a20f70186a0e2cea4", "53909ee020f70186a0e32b8d", "53909ee020f70186a0e32b96", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe52", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe5e", "5390a88c20f70186a0e985b9", "5390af8920f70186a0ed0d9c", "5390af8920f70186a0ed0d8f", "5390b0ca20f70186a0edb69e", "539089bb20f70186a0d997a2", "53908bcc20f70186a0dc4ac6", "53908cde20f70186a0dcdd68", "539096cb20f70186a0df8778"], "references": ["539087be20f70186a0d537e4", "539087c320f70186a0d54e1b", "539087cf20f70186a0d5d5ee", "539087d420f70186a0d5de59", "539087dd20f70186a0d634a2", "539087e720f70186a0d69653", "539087ef20f70186a0d6c8e7", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fbe", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa2a", "53908a7420f70186a0da4498", "53908a7420f70186a0da45d8", "53908a9620f70186a0da4b0d"], "authors": ["Erik Riedel", "Christos Faloutsos", "Gregory R.

Among them, nearest-neighbor queries are important in many settings, including spatial databases (Find the $k$ closest cities) and multimedia databases (Find the $k$ most similar images). Previous analyses have concluded that nearest-neighbor search is hopeless in high dimensions due to the notorious \u9a74curse of dimensionality.\u9a74 Here, we show that this may be overpessimistic. We show that what determines the search performance (at least for R-tree-like structures) is the intrinsic dimensionality of the data set and not the dimensionality of the address space (referred to as the embedding dimensionality). The typical (and often implicit) assumption in many previous studies is that the data is uniformly distributed, with independence between attributes. However, real data sets overwhelmingly disobey these assumptions; rather, they typically are skewed and exhibit intrinsic (\u9a74fractal\u9a74) dimensionalities that are much lower than their embedding dimension, e.g., due to subtle dependencies between attributes. In this paper, we show how the Hausdorff and Correlation fractal dimensions of a data set can yield extremely accurate formulas that can predict the I/O performance to within one standard deviation on multiple real and synthetic data sets. The practical contributions of this work are our accurate formulas, which can be used for query optimization in spatial and multimedia databases. The major theoretical contribution is the \u9a74deflation\u9a74 of the dimensionality curse: Our formulas and our experiments show that previous worst-case analyses of nearest-neighbor search in high dimensions are overpessimistic to the point of being unrealistic. The performance depends critically on the intrinsic (\u9a74fractal\u9a74) dimensionality as opposed to the embedding dimension that the uniformity and independence assumptions incorrectly imply.", "year": "2001", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "citations": ["5390975920f70186a0dfccb1", "5390985d20f70186a0e08069", "539099a220f70186a0e17bc1", "539099ec20f70186a0e1c0d2", "53909e8a20f70186a0e2cc19", "53909e8a20f70186a0e2d643", "53909ed120f70186a0e3055f", "53909ed120f70186a0e313fd", "53909ed120f70186a0e315b6", "53909f2c20f70186a0e37a48", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a512", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e55765", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d579", "5390a25820f70186a0e5ea8e", "5390a2e920f70186a0e676c1", "5390a45520f70186a0e717ae", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e759f0", "5390a4d020f70186a0e76001", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82e85", "5390a79f20f70186a0e92349", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab7d3", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab83d", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb0099", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba1bd", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebb897", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebca17", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebcb3e", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe580", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec5274", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec8855", "5390aefb20f70186a0ecc43d", "5390af8920f70186a0ecf8e8", "5390b36120f70186a0ef2648", "5390b63320f70186a0f1679a", "5390b64020f70186a0f1900a", "5390b72e20f70186a0f2097b", "5390b7fe20f70186a0f27283", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2888a", "5390b9d520f70186a0f306e3", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c295", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40c50", "5390bded20f70186a0f4881a", "558adf5a612c41e6b9d3bfb3", "5390c04520f70186a0f56bfa", "558b02ee612c41e6b9d404d9", "53908b4920f70186a0dbb09b", "5390962020f70186a0df4cb3"], "references": ["539087ae20f70186a0d4e51c", "539087c320f70186a0d54c85", "539087d920f70186a0d60e53", "539087d920f70186a0d60e54", "539087dd20f70186a0d6448d", "539087dd20f70186a0d644e0", "539087e120f70186a0d66900", "539087e120f70186a0d66911", "539087e720f70186a0d6934c", "539087e720f70186a0d6934e", "539087e720f70186a0d69659", "539087eb20f70186a0d6a40d", "539087f320f70186a0d6eddf", "539087f320f70186a0d6f7af", "539087f820f70186a0d72761", "5390880220f70186a0d75efd", "539089ab20f70186a0d96ba4", "539089bb20f70186a0d98acb", "539089bb20f70186a0d9940b", "5390879920f70186a0d4152b", "5390879920f70186a0d41e23", "53908a5720f70186a0d9fbd9", "53908a5720f70186a0da0086", "53908a5720f70186a0da013a", "53908a5720f70186a0da0b76", "53908a7420f70186a0da453f", "53908a9620f70186a0da472a", "53908a9620f70186a0da472b", "53908a9620f70186a0da47d6", "53908a7420f70186a0da4683", "53908a9620f70186a0da4703", "53908a9620f70186a0da4c55", "53908a9620f70186a0da4ce5", "53908a9620f70186a0da4cfa", "53908a9620f70186a0da4e4a", "53908a9620f70186a0da4e41", "53908af920f70186a0dafe6b", "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9e4f"], "authors": ["Flip Korn", "Bernd-Uwe Pagel", "Christos Faloutsos"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a565c60b4bede9e97738"}}, {"index": "539089d220f70186a0d9ab5c", "title": "Analysis of the Clustering Properties of the Hilbert Space-Filling Curve", "abstract": "Several schemes for the linear mapping of a multidimensional space have been proposed for various applications, such as access methods for spatio-temporal databases and image compression. In these applications, one of the most desired properties from such linear mappings is clustering, which means the locality between objects in the multidimensional space being preserved in the linear space. It is widely believed that the Hilbert space-filling curve achieves the best clustering [1], [14]. In this paper, we analyze the clustering property of the Hilbert space-filling curve by deriving closed-form formulas for the number of clusters in a given query region of an arbitrary shape (e.g., polygons and polyhedra). Both the asymptotic solution for the general case and the exact solution for a special case generalize previous work [14]. They agree with the empirical results that the number of clusters depends on the hypersurface area of the query region and not on its hypervolume. We also show that the Hilbert curve achieves better clustering than the z curve. From a practical point of view, the formulas given in this paper provide a simple measure that can be used to predict the required disk access behaviors and, hence, the total access time.", "year": "2001", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "citations": ["5390979920f70186a0dffd73", "5390979920f70186a0e00fef", "5390981d20f70186a0e04656", "5390981d20f70186a0e05f72", "5390981d20f70186a0e06117", "5390981d20f70186a0e06954", "5390985d20f70186a0e07f3c", "539098b820f70186a0e0c121", "539098dc20f70186a0e0d08b", "539098dc20f70186a0e0d8f1", "5390990f20f70186a0e0fdaf", "5390995d20f70186a0e1608a", "539099a220f70186a0e1802d", "539099b320f70186a0e19822", "53909a0220f70186a0e1f1aa", "53909a0220f70186a0e1fc7f", "53909a0220f70186a0e20312", "53909a9320f70186a0e21a6e", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2eac1", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2f18a", "53909ed120f70186a0e3055f", "53909eef20f70186a0e361a5", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3f736", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3f7b8", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401ce", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40bbf", "53909fbc20f70186a0e41c30", "53909fbd20f70186a0e42b3b", "53909fca20f70186a0e44fa3", "53909fca20f70186a0e45001", "5390a01420f70186a0e47f7c", "5390a05920f70186a0e49355", "5390a05920f70186a0e497d1", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c06a", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c6cf", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c6d6", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c825", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4d390", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4ee4c", "5390a1d420f70186a0e574b3", "5390a28020f70186a0e62d59", "5390a2be20f70186a0e63f46", "5390a2be20f70186a0e64c52", "5390a2e920f70186a0e674cb", "5390a30b20f70186a0e68ad6", "5390a30b20f70186a0e698c7", "5390a30b20f70186a0e6ac54", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6ce22", "5390a45520f70186a0e711ab", "5390a4d020f70186a0e7600e", "5390a54620f70186a0e76b9e", "5390a55520f70186a0e7960a", "5390a55520f70186a0e7960b", "5390a55520f70186a0e79d51", "5390a5b020f70186a0e7de50", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7eabf", "5390a63c20f70186a0e8155d", "5390a63c20f70186a0e83441", "5390a79f20f70186a0e922ff", "5390a79f20f70186a0e922fc", "5390a88c20f70186a0e98c63", "5390a8db20f70186a0e9d8e9", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea1c17", "5390a96f20f70186a0ea3795", "5390a96f20f70186a0ea3e66", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea5e8a", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea6dbf", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea6dc0", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea6db5", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea7f13", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab7d0", "5390ab8820f70186a0eafdbf", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb1533", "5390aca920f70186a0eb95bc", "5390aca920f70186a0eb9c08", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba933", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebb88e", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebc0f5", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebc4ec", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebdd40", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe0c0", "5390ad8920f70186a0ebff45", "5390ad8920f70186a0ec0469", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec5276", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec8c05", "5390aeba20f70186a0eca43b", "5390af8920f70186a0ecff69", "5390af8920f70186a0ed0710", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5bd3", "5390b13020f70186a0edd33d", "5390b13020f70186a0eddd99", "5390b19020f70186a0ee065c", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3f2e", "5390b2d620f70186a0eeb699", "5390b2d720f70186a0eec983", "5390b2fc20f70186a0eee906", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef5fda", "5390b44620f70186a0ef818e", "5390b44620f70186a0ef947a", "5390b48420f70186a0efaceb", "5390b4c320f70186a0efe05f", "5390b52620f70186a0f03ee6", "5390b56a20f70186a0f0491a", "5390b63320f70186a0f1676d", "5390b64020f70186a0f1aa04", "5390b68720f70186a0f1d31e", "5390b71120f70186a0f1fe66", "5390b72d20f70186a0f20302", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2875f", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2888a", "5390b86b20f70186a0f291bc", "5390b9d520f70186a0f30050", "5390b9d520f70186a0f3124f", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c6e2", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c6ee", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3e25e", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f403b0", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f412dd", "5390bd1520f70186a0f433b4", "5390bda020f70186a0f477a7", "5390bded20f70186a0f48664", "5390bded20f70186a0f4929e", "5390be6620f70186a0f4c367", "558aca8d612c41e6b9d3a3c1", "5390be6620f70186a0f4cbca", "558b1a20612c41e6b9d43570", "558afc73612c41e6b9d3f9e5", "5390881220f70186a0d7e744", "5390881720f70186a0d8053e", "5390893e20f70186a0d93128", "539089d320f70186a0d9b009", "53908a5720f70186a0da030b", "53908a7420f70186a0da4491", "53908a9720f70186a0da626d", "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9a8d", "53908d6520f70186a0dd26d4", "5390962020f70186a0df381b"], "references": ["539087a620f70186a0d4968c", "539087a620f70186a0d49842", "5390877f20f70186a0d2fd65", "5390877f20f70186a0d2fd6e", "539087be20f70186a0d537e4", "539087dd20f70186a0d643f7", "5390880d20f70186a0d7b196", "5390878a20f70186a0d36ee8", "539089bb20f70186a0d986f0", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa4f", "5390879220f70186a0d3c62c", "5390879920f70186a0d41e24", "53908b2a20f70186a0db949e"], "authors": ["Bongki Moon", "H. v.

We present a statistically sound method for estimating the DGX parameters based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). We applied DGX to a wide variety of real world data sets, such as sales data from a large retailer chain, us-age data from AT&T, and Internet clickstream data; in all cases, DGX fits these distributions very well, with almost a 99% correlation coefficient in quantile-quantile plots. Our algorithm also scales very well because it requires only a single pass over the data.

Previous analyses have concluded that nearest-neighbor search is hopeless in high dimensions due to the notorious \u9a74curse of dimensionality.\u9a74 Here, we show that this may be overpessimistic. We show that what determines the search performance (at least for R-tree-like structures) is the intrinsic dimensionality of the data set and not the dimensionality of the address space (referred to as the embedding dimensionality). The typical (and often implicit) assumption in many previous studies is that the data is uniformly distributed, with independence between attributes. However, real data sets overwhelmingly disobey these assumptions; rather, they typically are skewed and exhibit intrinsic (\u9a74fractal\u9a74) dimensionalities that are much lower than their embedding dimension, e.g., due to subtle dependencies between attributes. In this paper, we show how the Hausdorff and Correlation fractal dimensions of a data set can yield extremely accurate formulas that can predict the I/O performance to within one standard deviation on multiple real and synthetic data sets. The practical contributions of this work are our accurate formulas, which can be used for query optimization in spatial and multimedia databases. The major theoretical contribution is the \u9a74deflation\u9a74 of the dimensionality curse: Our formulas and our experiments show that previous worst-case analyses of nearest-neighbor search in high dimensions are overpessimistic to the point of being unrealistic. The performance depends critically on the intrinsic (\u9a74fractal\u9a74) dimensionality as opposed to the embedding dimension that the uniformity and independence assumptions incorrectly imply.", "year": "2001", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "citations": ["5390975920f70186a0dfccb1", "5390985d20f70186a0e08069", "539099a220f70186a0e17bc1", "539099ec20f70186a0e1c0d2", "53909e8a20f70186a0e2cc19", "53909e8a20f70186a0e2d643", "53909ed120f70186a0e3055f", "53909ed120f70186a0e313fd", "53909ed120f70186a0e315b6", "53909f2c20f70186a0e37a48", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a512", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e55765", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d579", "5390a25820f70186a0e5ea8e", "5390a2e920f70186a0e676c1", "5390a45520f70186a0e717ae", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e759f0", "5390a4d020f70186a0e76001", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82e85", "5390a79f20f70186a0e92349", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab7d3", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab83d", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb0099", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba1bd", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebb897", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebca17", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebcb3e", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe580", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec5274", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec8855", "5390aefb20f70186a0ecc43d", "5390af8920f70186a0ecf8e8", "5390b36120f70186a0ef2648", "5390b63320f70186a0f1679a", "5390b64020f70186a0f1900a", "5390b72e20f70186a0f2097b", "5390b7fe20f70186a0f27283", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2888a", "5390b9d520f70186a0f306e3", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c295", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40c50", "5390bded20f70186a0f4881a", "558adf5a612c41e6b9d3bfb3", "5390c04520f70186a0f56bfa", "558b02ee612c41e6b9d404d9", "53908b4920f70186a0dbb09b", "5390962020f70186a0df4cb3"], "references": ["539087ae20f70186a0d4e51c", "539087c320f70186a0d54c85", "539087d920f70186a0d60e53", "539087d920f70186a0d60e54", "539087dd20f70186a0d6448d", "539087dd20f70186a0d644e0", "539087e120f70186a0d66900", "539087e120f70186a0d66911", "539087e720f70186a0d6934c", "539087e720f70186a0d6934e", "539087e720f70186a0d69659", "539087eb20f70186a0d6a40d", "539087f320f70186a0d6eddf", "539087f320f70186a0d6f7af", "539087f820f70186a0d72761", "5390880220f70186a0d75efd", "539089ab20f70186a0d96ba4", "539089bb20f70186a0d98acb", "539089bb20f70186a0d9940b", "5390879920f70186a0d4152b", "5390879920f70186a0d41e23", "53908a5720f70186a0d9fbd9", "53908a5720f70186a0da0086", "53908a5720f70186a0da013a", "53908a5720f70186a0da0b76", "53908a7420f70186a0da453f", "53908a9620f70186a0da472a", "53908a9620f70186a0da472b", "53908a9620f70186a0da47d6", "53908a7420f70186a0da4683", "53908a9620f70186a0da4703", "53908a9620f70186a0da4c55", "53908a9620f70186a0da4ce5", "53908a9620f70186a0da4cfa", "53908a9620f70186a0da4e4a", "53908a9620f70186a0da4e41", "53908af920f70186a0dafe6b", "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9e4f"], "authors": ["Flip Korn", "Bernd-Uwe Pagel", "Christos Faloutsos"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a63fc60b4bee2dd4cf4b"}}, {"index": "539089d220f70186a0d9ab5c", "title": "Analysis of the Clustering Properties of the Hilbert Space-Filling Curve", "abstract": "Several schemes for the linear mapping of a multidimensional space have been proposed for various applications, such as access methods for spatio-temporal databases and image compression. In these applications, one of the most desired properties from such linear mappings is clustering, which means the locality between objects in the multidimensional space being preserved in the linear space. It is widely believed that the Hilbert space-filling curve achieves the best clustering [1], [14]. In this paper, we analyze the clustering property of the Hilbert space-filling curve by deriving closed-form formulas for the number of clusters in a given query region of an arbitrary shape (e.g., polygons and polyhedra). Both the asymptotic solution for the general case and the exact solution for a special case generalize previous work [14]. They agree with the empirical results that the number of clusters depends on the hypersurface area of the query region and not on its hypervolume. We also show that the Hilbert curve achieves better clustering than the z curve.

Unfortunately, the traditional Zipf distribution often fails to model them well. In this paper, we propose a new probability distribution, the Discrete Gaussian Exponential (DGX), to achieve excellent fits in a wide variety of settings; our new distribution includes the Zipf distribution as a special case. We present a statistically sound method for estimating the DGX parameters based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). We applied DGX to a wide variety of real world data sets, such as sales data from a large retailer chain, us-age data from AT&T, and Internet clickstream data; in all cases, DGX fits these distributions very well, with almost a 99% correlation coefficient in quantile-quantile plots. Our algorithm also scales very well because it requires only a single pass over the data. Finally, we illustrate the power of DGX as a new tool for data mining tasks, such as outlier detection.", "year": "2001", "venue": "Proceedings of the seventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe04", "539098b820f70186a0e0a843", "539098b820f70186a0e0ad7a", "5390994d20f70186a0e124c5", "5390995d20f70186a0e15cac", "5390995d20f70186a0e166b2", "539099a220f70186a0e1800e", "539099b320f70186a0e195e7", "539099ec20f70186a0e1c5ad", "53909e7c20f70186a0e2c074", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2da07", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2e011", "53909ed120f70186a0e3082b", "53909f6920f70186a0e3ab46", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4ee91", "5390a17720f70186a0e52453", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75003", "5390a63c20f70186a0e81577", "5390a80f20f70186a0e97764", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea1172", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea5b97", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebdf2d", "5390af8820f70186a0ecf1e6", "5390b2d720f70186a0eebf7c", "5390b2fc20f70186a0eef96a", "5390b68720f70186a0f1bcb0", "5390b71120f70186a0f1ec9f", "5390b78a20f70186a0f2447b", "5390b7fe20f70186a0f26d0e", "5390b8d620f70186a0f2ab4c", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2c039", "5390ba3820f70186a0f35131", "53908a7420f70186a0da41cc"], "references": ["539087c720f70186a0d57bf1", "5390881720f70186a0d7fbc5", "53908a9620f70186a0da4a5a", "53908cde20f70186a0dcde13"], "authors": ["Zhiqiang Bi", "Christos Faloutsos", "Flip Korn"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a65dc60b4bee2dd66824"}}, {"index": "53908b2a20f70186a0db9753", "title": "NetCube: A Scalable Tool for Fast Data Mining and Compression", "abstract": "", "year": "2001", "venue": "Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases", "citations": ["539098b820f70186a0e0adb3", "539098b820f70186a0e0b3ae", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4d3cb", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea1cba", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe914", "5390b2d720f70186a0eec103", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef2df3", "5390b5ed20f70186a0f0c19b", "5390958a20f70186a0defdb7"], "references": ["539087d920f70186a0d5ff83", "539087f320f70186a0d6f86e", "539087f320f70186a0d6f86c", "539087f320f70186a0d6f879", "539087f320f70186a0d6f86b", "539087f820f70186a0d711f1", "539087f820f70186a0d71233", "5390878a20f70186a0d379c9", "53908a5720f70186a0da08f2", "53908a7420f70186a0da449a", "53908a7420f70186a0da45de", "53908a7420f70186a0da45ec", "53908a7420f70186a0da468e", "53908af920f70186a0db0104", "53908af920f70186a0db00e9"], "authors": ["Dimitris Margaritis", "Christos Faloutsos", "Sebastian Thrun"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a67ac60b4bee2dd7d939"}}, {"index": "539089bb20f70186a0d997b2", "title": "Identifying Web Browsing Trends and Patterns", "abstract": "Since it entered the popular culture in 1994, the World Wide Web has grown from approximately two million servers to more than 110 million in 2001, according to the Internet Software Consortium.

However, no results exist for nonpoint spatial data, like 2D regions (e.g., islands), 3D volumes (e.g., physical objects in the real world), etc. This is exactly the problem we solve in this paper. Based on experimental evidence that real areas and volumes follow a \u9a74power law,\u9a74 that we named REGAL (REGion Area Law), we show 1) the theoretical implications of our model and its connection with the ubiquitous fractals and 2) the first of its practical uses, namely, the selectivity estimation for range queries.

As processor performance increases and memory cost decreases, system intelligence continues to move away from the CPU and into peripherals. The authors propose using an active disk storage device that combines on-drive processing and memory with software downloadability to allow disks to execute application-level functions directly at the device.With active disks, application-specific functions access the excess computation power in drives. Active disks combine the requisite processing power of general-purpose disk-drive microprocessors with the special-purpose functionality of end-user programmability.The authors' experiment showed that active disks can accelerate an existing database system by moving data-intensive processing to the disks, thereby reducing the server CPU's processing load. The active disk approach eliminates the need for the PC processor, its memory subsystem, and I/O backplane, which makes active disks relatively inexpensive. The development of new data-intensive algorithms requires large amounts of disk space and high data-transfer rates for various processing tasks, with richer database structures, new content, new data sources, and novel applications for collected data. The authors contend that active disks can meet these needs while offering the parallelism available in large storage systems.", "year": "2001", "venue": "Computer", "citations": ["5390979920f70186a0e009b0", "5390985d20f70186a0e07fa0", "5390985e20f70186a0e0940f", "5390990f20f70186a0e0f663", "5390994d20f70186a0e12a6a", "539099a220f70186a0e18c01", "539099b320f70186a0e1b1ba", "539099ec20f70186a0e1c641", "53909ee020f70186a0e32ba9", "53909f6920f70186a0e39fda", "53909f6920f70186a0e3ad9e", "53909f8220f70186a0e3c30f", "53909f8220f70186a0e3ca9d", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fb8d", "53909fbd20f70186a0e420b3", "5390a01420f70186a0e4795c", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4a331", "5390a17720f70186a0e52aae", "5390a25820f70186a0e5f76e", "5390a2e920f70186a0e67a3e", "5390a6b120f70186a0e85c77", "5390a6b120f70186a0e85c68", "5390a72220f70186a0e897b4", "5390a88c20f70186a0e980c6", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea84a6", "5390ac5720f70186a0eb6d3f", "5390ad8920f70186a0ec0487", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec57a5", "5390aeba20f70186a0eca7d9", "5390afc920f70186a0ed21ca", "5390afc920f70186a0ed2192", "5390b19020f70186a0edeadc", "5390b19020f70186a0edfa26", "5390b24420f70186a0ee7b1f", "5390b29820f70186a0eeb07d", "5390b2fc20f70186a0eee978", "5390b52620f70186a0f04522", "5390baa120f70186a0f3830c", "5390bae520f70186a0f3bc53", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c074", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f403b0", "5390bd1520f70186a0f440c6", "5390bda020f70186a0f458f7", "5390bda020f70186a0f47cec", "558b959c612c6b62e5e8c1b9", "558b4d8e612c41e6b9d48a66", "558b7fea612c6b62e5e8a0a1", "558bd1b80cf25dbdbb04dd30", "558b81ca612c6b62e5e8a407", "539088b820f70186a0d8fafc", "53908bcc20f70186a0dc4ac6", "53908bcc20f70186a0dc5006", "53908bcc20f70186a0dc500d", "53908d6520f70186a0dd17ab", "5390962020f70186a0df4952"], "references": ["539087ef20f70186a0d6c8e7", "539087ef20f70186a0d6ca61", "539087ef20f70186a0d6ca5e", "5390880220f70186a0d75ed8", "5390881e20f70186a0d847c4", "53908a7420f70186a0da2450", "53908a9620f70186a0da4bb0", "5390956e20f70186a0deb94d"], "authors": ["Erik Riedel", "Christos Faloutsos", "Garth A.

A field can be represented by a set of cells containing some explicit measured sample points and by arbitrary interpolation methods used to derive implicit values on nonsampled positions.

For such applications, it is important to measure the similarity between two objects using the distance between them. Focusing on this problem, this paper proposes the Slim-tree, a new dynamic tree for organizing metric data sets in pages of fixed size. The Slim-tree uses the triangle inequality to prune distance calculations needed to answer similarity queries over objects in metric spaces. The proposed insertion algorithm uses new policies to select the nodes where incoming objects are stored. When a node overflows, the Slim-tree uses a Minimal Spanning Tree to help with the split. The new insertion algorithm leads to a tree with high storage utilization and improved query performance. The Slim-tree is the first metric access method to tackle the problem of overlap between nodes in metric spaces and to propose a technique to minimize it. The proposed \u9a74fat-factor\u9a74 is a way to quantify whether a given tree can be improved and also to compare two trees. We show how to use the fat-factor to achieve accurate estimates of the search performance and also how to improve the performance of a metric tree through the proposed \u9a74Slim-down\u9a74 algorithm. This paper also presents a new tool in the arsenal of resources of Slim-tree aimed at visualizing it. Visualization is a powerful tool for interactive data mining and for the visual tracking of the behavior of a tree under updates. Finally, we present a formula to estimate the number of disk accesses in range queries. Results from experiments with real and synthetic data sets show that the new algorithms of the Slim-tree lead to performance improvements.

Other familiar graphs include CAD circuits, phone records, gene sequences, city streets, social networks and academic citations. Any kind of relationship, such as actors appearing in movies, can be represented as a graph. This work presents a data mining tool, called ANF, that can quickly answer a number of interesting questions on graph-represented data, such as the following. How robust is the Internet to failures? What are the most influential database papers? Are there gender differences in movie appearance patterns? At its core, ANF is based on a fast and memory-efficient approach for approximating the complete \"neighbourhood function\" for a graph. For the Internet graph (268K nodes), ANF's highly-accurate approximation is more than 700 times faster than the exact computation. This reduces the running time from nearly a day to a matter of a minute or two, allowing users to perform ad hoc drill-down tasks and to repeatedly answer questions about changing data sources. To enable this drill-down, ANF employs new techniques for approximating neighbourhood-type functions for graphs with distinguished nodes and/or edges. When compared to the best existing approximation, ANF's approach is both faster and more accurate, given the same resources. Additionally, unlike previous approaches, ANF scales gracefully to handle disk resident graphs. Finally, we present some of our results from mining large graphs using ANF.", "year": "2002", "venue": "Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390972920f70186a0dfacb2", "5390975920f70186a0dfcca8", "5390979920f70186a0dffb58", "5390981d20f70186a0e05a27", "5390981d20f70186a0e06012", "5390985d20f70186a0e06e5e", "539098b820f70186a0e0a848", "539098b820f70186a0e0a843", "5390990f20f70186a0e0f632", "5390995d20f70186a0e15cac", "5390995d20f70186a0e160bc", "5390995d20f70186a0e16636", "539099a220f70186a0e18007", "539099b320f70186a0e19a4d", "539099b320f70186a0e19a2a", "53909a0320f70186a0e20469", "53909e7c20f70186a0e2c074", "53909e8a20f70186a0e2d3ca", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2e011", "53909ed120f70186a0e30c00", "53909ed120f70186a0e30f62", "53909ed120f70186a0e314f1", "53909eef20f70186a0e358a6", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a2e1", "53909f6920f70186a0e3ab45", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40f7d", "53909fbd20f70186a0e41e0d", "53909fca20f70186a0e44f26", "5390a01420f70186a0e47fd9", "5390a17720f70186a0e5244b", "5390a1e620f70186a0e5982f", "5390a25820f70186a0e5f0ea", "5390a30b20f70186a0e69ca4", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6bc08", "5390a54720f70186a0e78934", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea1172", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea6ba3", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb122c", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebb884", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec5414", "5390aeba20f70186a0ec996f", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecaba1", "5390af8820f70186a0eced76", "5390af8920f70186a0ed0289", "5390afc920f70186a0ed2c9e", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed3ea0", "5390b1d220f70186a0ee134b", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3f7f", "5390b2d720f70186a0eebf7c", "5390b2d720f70186a0eed2a3", "5390b2fc20f70186a0eeeca1", "5390b36120f70186a0ef28e1", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef5e28", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef700f", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef7afb", "5390b72d20f70186a0f20301", "5390b78a20f70186a0f23bef", "5390b7fe20f70186a0f26cfc", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a685", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a691", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f33a15", "5390ba3820f70186a0f352eb", "5390ba3820f70186a0f3686e", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40bea", "5390bd1520f70186a0f432e5", "5390bd1520f70186a0f432f4", "5390bed320f70186a0f4e2cb", "558b183c612c41e6b9d43071", "558ac708612c41e6b9d39f27", "55323bd345cec66b6f9daa91", "539095ba20f70186a0df099a", "539095ba20f70186a0df0f8b", "539095ba20f70186a0df0f8c", "5390962020f70186a0df4c88", "5390962020f70186a0df4cb4", "5390962020f70186a0df4ccd"], "references": ["539087ae20f70186a0d4e51e", "539087e720f70186a0d6805b", "539087ef20f70186a0d6e1ac", "539087f820f70186a0d71f36", "539087fe20f70186a0d75e22", "5390880220f70186a0d78472", "5390881720f70186a0d804c1", "5390877920f70186a0d2d58e", "539088b820f70186a0d90cae", "539089d320f70186a0d9b310", "5390879520f70186a0d3faf1"], "authors": ["Christopher R.

The first novelty of our approach is a method to automatically derive a \"vocabulary\" from each class of video clips, using the powerful method of \"Independent Component Analysis\" (ICA). Second, the method is unified in that it works with both video and audio information, and gives vocabulary describing not only the still images, but also motion and the audio part. Further-more, this vocabulary is natural in that it is closely related to human perceptual processing. More specifically, every class of video clips gives a list of \"basis functions\", which can compress its members very well. Once we represent video clips in \"vocabularies\", we can do classification and pattern discovery. For the classification of a video clip, we propose using compression: we test which of the \"vocabularies\" can compress the video clip best, and we assign it to the corresponding class.For data mining, we inspect the basis functions of each video genre class and identify genre characteristics such as fast motions/transitions, more harmonic audio, etc. In experiments on real data of 62 news and 43 commercial clips, our method achieved overall accuracy of \u9a74 81%.", "year": "2002", "venue": "ICADL '02 Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Asian Digital Libraries: Digital Libraries: People, Knowledge, and Technology", "citations": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe4e", "5390981d20f70186a0e043cd", "539099a220f70186a0e17b3a", "5390a05920f70186a0e49d05", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e543fa", "5390a93b20f70186a0e9fd85", "5390aaf920f70186a0ead53d", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec8b4f", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef4193", "5390b44620f70186a0ef886c"], "references": ["53909eef20f70186a0e34526", "53909eef20f70186a0e3499b", "5390a01420f70186a0e4712a", "539087cf20f70186a0d5c117", "5390b68720f70186a0f1af9e", "539087f320f70186a0d6f167", "5390880720f70186a0d794f4", "539089bb20f70186a0d9962c", "53908af920f70186a0daebe7", "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9fae", "53908d6620f70186a0dd2b9e"], "authors": ["Jia-Yu Pan", "Christos Faloutsos"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a8f7c60b4bee2df672de"}}, {"index": "5390958a20f70186a0df05b5", "title": "Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "abstract": "KDD-2003, the Ninth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, was held in Washington, DC, U.S.A., on August 24-27, 2003. KDD is the leading international forum for the exchange of research results and practical experience in field of knowledge discovery and data mining. As the mountains of data available to organizations and individuals continue to grow without limit, and the need to extract useful knowledge from them becomes ever more intense, scientists, government workers and business people turn to the KDD community for solutions. The volume you have in your hands (or on your screen) contains a snapshot of a year of developments in this field; we hope you find it useful and rewarding.The KDD-2003 technical program featured two parallel research tracks and an industrial/government track. The latter was the result of expanding the scope of KDD's industrial track to reflect the increased importance of knowledge discovery and data mining in government and vice-versa. The program also featured three keynote speakers, nine workshops, seven tutorials and two panels. The 2003 KDD Cup competition focused on mining citation networks and data cleaning in large bibliographic repositories. Dozens of exhibits from vendors and other organizations added to the ferment, and underscored the conference's dual role as an industry and academic event.Continuing its tradition of collocation with related conferences, this year KDD was collocated with ICML-2003, the Twentieth International Conference on Machine Learning. The two conferences held a joint session on the first day of KDD (last of ICML), which featured a selection of papers from the two conferences and a joint keynote speaker. COLT-2003, the Sixteenth Annual Conference on Computational Learning Theory, was also collocated with KDD and ICML.We received a large number of submissions, and the selection process was extremely competitive. Each paper was independently reviewed by three members of the program committee for originality, significance, technical quality, and clarity of presentation. This was followed by discussion among the reviewers and final decisions. Of the 258 research track submissions received, 34 were accepted as full papers for oral presentation, and 36 were accepted for poster presentation (13% and 14% of submissions, respectively). The industrial/government track received 40 submissions, of which 12 were accepted for oral presentation and 10 were accepted for poster presentation (30% and 25%). Additionally, ne research submission was reassigned to the industrial/government track, and accepted for oral presentation there.The resulting program was notable for its diversity and vitality. Alongside traditional KDD topics like classification, clustering, frequent sets, scalability, and temporal data, we also saw papers in rapidly growing areas like graph and relational mining, data streams, semi-structured data, and privacy. Application areas included the Web, bioinformatics, health care, marketing, crime-fighting, and many others.", "year": "2003", "venue": "The Ninth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining", "citations": ["5390b29820f70186a0ee9c2b"], "references": [], "authors": ["Lise Getoor", "Ted Senator", "Pedro Domingos", "Christos Faloutsos"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a6bac60b4bee2ddb1646"}}, {"index": "539095ba20f70186a0df0953", "title": "The power-method: a comprehensive estimation technique for multi-dimensional queries", "abstract": "Existing estimation approaches for multi-dimensional databases often rely on the assumption that data distribution in a small region is uniform, which seldom holds in practice.

Categorical attributes abound in databases. The Car Make, Gender, Occupation, etc. fields in a automobile insurance database are very informative. Sadly, categorical data is not easily amenable to similarity computations. A domain expert might manually specify some or all of the similarity relationships, but this is error-prone and not feasible for attributes with large domains, nor is it useful for cross-attribute similarities, such as between Gender and Occupation. External similarity functions define a similarity between, say, Car Makes by looking at how they co-occur with the other categorical attributes. We exploit a rich duality between random walks on graphs and electrical circuits to develop REP, an external similarity function. REP is theoretically grounded while the only prior work was ad-hoc. The usefulness of REP is shown in two experiments. First, we cluster categorical attribute values showing improved inferred relationships.

Their limited resources (CPU, memory and/or communication bandwidth and power) pose some interesting challenges. We need both powerful and concise \"languages\" to represent the important features of the data, which can (a) adapt and handle arbitrary periodic components, including bursts, and (b) require little memory and a single pass over the data. We propose AWSOM (Arbitrary Window Stream mOdeling Method), which allows sensors in remote or hostile environments to efficiently and effectively discover interesting patterns and trends. This can be done automatically, i.e., with no user intervention and expert tuning before or during data gathering. Our algorithms require limited resources and can thus be incorporated in sensors, possibly alongside a distributed query processing engine [9, 5, 22]. Updates are performed in constant time, using logarithmic space. Existing, state of the art forecasting methods (SARIMA, GARCH, etc) fall short on one or more of these requirements. To the best of our knowledge, AWSOM is the first method that has all the above characteristics. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that AWSOM discovers meaningful patterns over long time periods. Thus, the patterns can also be used to make long-range forecasts, which are notoriously difficult to perform. In fact, AWSOM outperforms manually set up auto-regressive models, both in terms of long-term pattern detection and modeling, as well as by at least 10\u00d7 in resource consumption.", "year": "2003", "venue": "VLDB '03 Proceedings of the 29th international conference on Very large data bases - Volume 29", "citations": ["5390979920f70186a0e00cd4", "5390981d20f70186a0e04512", "5390981d20f70186a0e04507", "5390985d20f70186a0e06e5d", "5390985d20f70186a0e06e79", "539098b820f70186a0e0ad83", "539098b820f70186a0e0ad9a", "539098b820f70186a0e0adf0", "539098dc20f70186a0e0e1b4", "5390990f20f70186a0e0ff55", "539099b320f70186a0e19be9", "53909fbc20f70186a0e41c17", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4a904", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4ec7a", "5390a17720f70186a0e5239a", "5390a17720f70186a0e53c1d", "5390a1d420f70186a0e58690", "5390a1d420f70186a0e58be1", "5390a40520f70186a0e6eebb", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e7501b", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e7506c", "5390a8b220f70186a0e9cd72", "5390ab8820f70186a0eaff84", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb1500", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba440", "5390b29820f70186a0ee8eb5", "5390b2fc20f70186a0eef946", "5390b36120f70186a0ef142c", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e274", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40a3b", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f41383", "5390bfa220f70186a0f542cb", "5390bfa220f70186a0f542ae", "558b4fc1612c41e6b9d48ea9", "558bd2f90cf23f2dfc593c7e", "5390962020f70186a0df4701"], "references": ["53909f6920f70186a0e3a97e", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a975", "5390877920f70186a0d2d018", "5390877f20f70186a0d2ff0a", "539087c320f70186a0d53d03", "5390880220f70186a0d75ed8", "5390880720f70186a0d79a53", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2e3", "5390881220f70186a0d7ee5e", "5390881e20f70186a0d847c4", "5390882420f70186a0d890a5", "5390882420f70186a0d894b2", "5390882d20f70186a0d8daa7", "5390882d20f70186a0d8daca", "5390882d20f70186a0d8daa6", "53908a4020f70186a0d9f3f1", "53908a9620f70186a0da4742", "53908a9620f70186a0da491a", "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9e86", "53908dff20f70186a0dd3efe"], "authors": ["Spiros Papadimitriou", "Anthony Brockwell", "Christos Faloutsos"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a814c60b4bee2deabd2d"}}, {"index": "5390958920f70186a0dee019", "title": "Power laws and the AS-level internet topology", "abstract": "In this paper, we study and characterize the topology of the Internet at the autonomous system (AS) level.

Users formulate audit expressions to specify the (sensitive) data subject to disclosure review. An audit component accepts audit expressions and returns all queries (deemed \"suspicious\") that accessed the specified data during their execution. The overhead of our approach on query processing is small, involving primarily the logging of each query string along with other minor annotations. Database triggers are used to capture updates in a backlog database. At the time of audit, a static analysis phase selects a subset of logged queries for further analysis.

Their limited resources (CPU, memory and/or communication bandwidth, and power) pose some interesting challenges. We need concise, expressive models to represent the important features of the data and that lend themselves to efficient estimation. In particular, under these severe constraints, we want models and estimation methods that (a) require little memory and a single pass over the data, (b) can adapt and handle arbitrary periodic components, and (c) can deal with various types of noise. We propose ${\\mathrm{AWSOM}}$ (Arbitrary Window Stream mOdeling Method), which allows sensors in remote or hostile environments to efficiently and effectively discover interesting patterns and trends. This can be done automatically, i.e., with no prior inspection of the data or any user intervention and expert tuning before or during data gathering. Our algorithms require limited resources and can thus be incorporated into sensors - possibly alongside a distributed query processing engine [10,6,27]. Updates are performed in constant time with respect to stream size using logarithmic space. Existing forecasting methods (SARIMA, GARCH, etc.) and \u201ctraditional\u201d Fourier and wavelet analysis fall short on one or more of these requirements. To the best of our knowledge, ${\\mathrm{AWSOM}}$ is the first framework that combines all of the above characteristics. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that ${\\mathrm{AWSOM}}$ discovers meaningful patterns over long time periods. Thus, the patterns can also be used to make long-range forecasts, which are notoriously difficult to perform. In fact, ${\\mathrm{AWSOM}}$ outperforms manually set up autoregressive models, both in terms of long-term pattern detection and modeling and by at least 10 x in resource consumption.", "year": "2004", "venue": "The VLDB Journal \u2014 The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases", "citations": ["539099a220f70186a0e18035", "53909ee020f70186a0e31e53", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e547d6", "5390a1d420f70186a0e58bb7", "5390a25820f70186a0e604fe", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f7b3", "5390a40520f70186a0e6fecb"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfacba", "5390877920f70186a0d2d018", "5390877f20f70186a0d2ff0a", "539087c320f70186a0d53d03", "5390880220f70186a0d75ed8", "5390880720f70186a0d79a53", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2e3", "5390881220f70186a0d7ee5e", "5390881e20f70186a0d847c4", "5390882420f70186a0d890a5", "5390882420f70186a0d894b2", "5390882d20f70186a0d8daa7", "5390882d20f70186a0d8daca", "5390882d20f70186a0d8daa6", "53908a4020f70186a0d9f3f1", "53908a9620f70186a0da4742", "53908a9620f70186a0da491a", "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9e86", "53908d6520f70186a0dd19f7", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a24", "53908dff20f70186a0dd3efe", "5390958a20f70186a0df05da", "5390962020f70186a0df4c88", "5390962020f70186a0df4ccf", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a97e", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a975", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a981"], "authors": ["Spiros Papadimitriou", "Anthony Brockwell", "Christos Faloutsos"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a80ec60b4bee2dea7000"}}, {"index": "5390972920f70186a0dfa825", "title": "Segmenting motion capture data into distinct behaviors", "abstract": "Much of the motion capture data used in animations, commercials, and video games is carefully segmented into distinct motions either at the time of capture or by hand after the capture session. As we move toward collecting more and longer motion sequences, however, automatic segmentation techniques will become important for processing the results in a reasonable time frame.We have found that straightforward, easy to implement segmentation techniques can be very effective for segmenting motion sequences into distinct behaviors. In this paper, we present three approaches for automatic segmentation. The first two approaches are online, meaning that the algorithm traverses the motion from beginning to end, creating the segmentation as it proceeds. The first assigns a cut when the intrinsic dimensionality of a local model of the motion suddenly increases. The second places a cut when the distribution of poses is observed to change. The third approach is a batch process and segments the sequence where consecutive frames belong to different elements of a Gaussian mixture model. We assess these three methods on fourteen motion sequences and compare the performance of the automatic methods to that of transitions selected manually.", "year": "2004", "venue": "GI '04 Proceedings of the 2004 Graphics Interface Conference", "citations": ["5390985d20f70186a0e0860a", "5390985d20f70186a0e0860e", "5390985d20f70186a0e08624", "5390985d20f70186a0e08608", "539098b820f70186a0e0aabb", "5390990f20f70186a0e1101f", "539099ec20f70186a0e1d117", "53909e7c20f70186a0e2c2d9", "53909e7c20f70186a0e2c2da", "53909eef20f70186a0e36a7c", "53909f2d20f70186a0e3829d", "53909f2d20f70186a0e395f3", "53909f6a20f70186a0e3af3c", "5390a01420f70186a0e477d6", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4be95", "5390a17720f70186a0e53aa2", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e55770", "5390a1d420f70186a0e569ee", "5390a1d420f70186a0e57383", "5390a25820f70186a0e5e7c4", "5390a25820f70186a0e5f7ac", "5390a2e920f70186a0e6840c", "5390a30b20f70186a0e68a1f", "5390a30b20f70186a0e69423", "5390a30b20f70186a0e6978b", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6d17b", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f642", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75df9", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7ed74", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7f2b2", "5390a63c20f70186a0e831b3", "5390a6b220f70186a0e8624f", "5390a6d920f70186a0e866ea", "5390a6d920f70186a0e885c2", "5390a72220f70186a0e88fd0", "5390a7f620f70186a0e94788", "5390a8b220f70186a0e9c577", "5390a8dc20f70186a0e9ed2e", "5390a9a420f70186a0ea5198", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea5e13", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebb852", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebcaf6", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec665e", "5390af8920f70186a0ed1240", "5390b04120f70186a0ed87c1", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda5c1", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda5c2", "5390b19020f70186a0edf8e2", "5390b1d220f70186a0ee1454", "5390b20120f70186a0ee59d3", "5390b29820f70186a0eeae89", "5390b29820f70186a0eeae83", "5390b2d620f70186a0eeb29a", "5390b2d620f70186a0eeb291", "5390b2d620f70186a0eebc95", "5390b48420f70186a0efa9f2", "5390b48420f70186a0efc7c4", "5390b86b20f70186a0f286f8", "5390b86b20f70186a0f28b58", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2b887", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2be29", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f34b14", "5390ba3820f70186a0f35798", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c28e", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c7d8", "5390bda020f70186a0f464bb", "5390bda020f70186a0f47a7d", "5390bded20f70186a0f48612", "5390bded20f70186a0f4915b", "5390bed320f70186a0f4e4c4", "5390bf1320f70186a0f50b81", "558b2217612c41e6b9d446bc", "558b4aa4612c41e6b9d48567", "55922dd20cf2c3a0875c9dd7"], "references": ["5390879920f70186a0d406e0", "539087e720f70186a0d69655", "539087f320f70186a0d6f315", "5390880220f70186a0d7716c", "5390880220f70186a0d77f96", "5390880720f70186a0d7889c", "5390880720f70186a0d794e1", "5390882d20f70186a0d8ded7", "5390882d20f70186a0d8ded6", "5390882d20f70186a0d8ded8", "5390882d20f70186a0d8ded9", "5390893e20f70186a0d944bc", "53908a5820f70186a0da1197", "53908a5820f70186a0da1194", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc15b", "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9fd2", "53908e0020f70186a0dd49f2", "5390958a20f70186a0df03e0", "5390b64020f70186a0f19986"], "authors": ["Jernej Barbi\u010d", "Alla Safonova", "Jia-Yu Pan", "Christos Faloutsos", "Jessica K.

This severely limits their applicability, since in practice movement is more complex, and individual objects may follow drastically diffferent motion patterns. In order to overcome these problems, we first introduce a general framework for monitoring and indexing moving objects, where (i) each boject computes individually the function that accurately captures its movement and (ii) a server indexes the object locations at a coarse level and processes queries using a filter-refinement mechanism. Our second contribution is a novel recursive motion function that supports a broad class of non-linear motion patterns. The function does not presume any a-priori movement but can postulate the particular motion of each object by examining its locations at recent timestamps. Finally. we propse an efficient indexing scheme that faciliates the processing of predicitive queries without false misses.", "year": "2004", "venue": "SIGMOD '04 Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data", "citations": ["5390975920f70186a0dfe097", "5390981d20f70186a0e04552", "5390985d20f70186a0e06e6f", "539099a220f70186a0e18d01", "53909a0220f70186a0e1f096", "53909eef20f70186a0e358ab", "53909f8220f70186a0e3c82c", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3ff79", "53909fca20f70186a0e45012", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e5641e", "5390a1d420f70186a0e57525", "5390a2be20f70186a0e64fd7", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6bbfd", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e7501b", "5390a55520f70186a0e79611", "5390a63c20f70186a0e81513", "5390a63c20f70186a0e81f99", "5390a77d20f70186a0e8e72a", "5390a79f20f70186a0e92355", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea6dc7", "5390aa7620f70186a0eaa73f", "5390ac1820f70186a0eb3eae", "5390ac5720f70186a0eb5dc3", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba440", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebae5b", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebaee4", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebbc89", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebbc86", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebc9ed", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec5281", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec5261", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec67d7", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecac9a", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5577", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda9cb", "5390b13020f70186a0edcb49", "5390b13020f70186a0edddaf", "5390b19020f70186a0edeb94", "5390b19020f70186a0edfaa1", "5390b20120f70186a0ee43a4", "5390b29820f70186a0ee959c", "5390b2fc20f70186a0eef969", "5390b36120f70186a0ef13fe", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef6f4c", "5390b44620f70186a0ef8199", "5390b44620f70186a0ef8b84", "5390b48420f70186a0efb50d", "5390b52620f70186a0f02c93", "5390b63320f70186a0f17d46", "5390b9d520f70186a0f302bb", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f33ae6", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d0f8", "5390bda020f70186a0f46015", "5390bded20f70186a0f48335", "558b00bb612c41e6b9d400a9", "558b8b4a612c6b62e5e8b2c4", "558bfa1a0cf2e30013db3f65", "55323b8645cec66b6f9da120"], "references": ["5390879920f70186a0d41e23", "539087ae20f70186a0d4e51c", "539087f320f70186a0d6f7a7", "539087fe20f70186a0d75e48", "5390880220f70186a0d75f0b", "5390882d20f70186a0d8dabe", "5390882d20f70186a0d8dac7", "53908b4920f70186a0dbbf8a", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe4e"], "authors": ["Yufei Tao", "Christos Faloutsos", "Dimitris Papadias", "Bin Liu"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a855c60b4bee2dedfc2d"}}, {"index": "5390975920f70186a0dfcd5d", "title": "Fractal dimension and vector quantization", "abstract": "We show that the performance of a vector quantizer for a self-similar data set is related to the intrinsic (\"fractal\") dimension of the data set.

Starting from first principles, we furnish a clear, information-theoretic criterion to choose a good cross-association as well as its parameters, namely, the number of row and column groups. We provide scalable algorithms to approach the optimal. Our algorithm is parameter-free, and requires no user intervention. In practice it scales linearly with the problem size, and is thus applicable to very large matrices.

Our driving application is 'network tomography', where we need to estimate the origin-destination (OD) traffic flows to determine, e.g., who is communicating with whom in a local area network. This information allows network engineers and managers to solve problems in design, routing, configuration debugging, monitoring and pricing. Unfortunately the direct measurement of the OD traffic is usually difficult, or even impossible; instead, we can easily measure the loads on every link, that is, sums of desirable OD flows.In this paper we propose i-FILTER, a method to solve this problem, which improves the state-of-the-art by (a) introducing explicit time dependence, and by (b) using realistic, non-Gaussian marginals in the statistical models for the traffic flows, as never attempted before. We give experiments on real data, where i-FILTER scales linearly with new observations and out-performs the best existing solutions, in a wide variety of settings.

In this paper, we present a novel robust solution which detects high dimensional outliers based on user examples and tolerates incorrect inputs. It studies the behavior of projections of such a few examples, to discover further objects that are outstanding in the projection where many examples are outlying.

Technological advances have enabled the creation of huge data repositories. The need to turn such data into useful knowledge has fueled the development of data mining techniques. From a database perspective, the emphasis is often placed on scalability and efficiency. Practical approaches can afford only a single or, at best, a few passes over the data, i.e., the algorithmic complexity must be linear with respect to dataset size. Recently, in addition to the data warehouse model where data from multiple sources are integrated into a large store, the streaming model is emerging as an alternative data processing paradigm. Several applications produce a continuous stream of data (e.g., phone call detail records, web clickstreams or sensor measurements) that is too large to store in its entirety. Therefore, in stream mining we are allowed only a single pass over the data, without random access. Upon arrival of new observations, we have to incrementally update the data model. Furthermore, space complexity must be sublinear with respect to dataset size. In this thesis we develop spatial and stream mining tools for discovery of interesting patterns. These patterns summarise the data, enable forecasting of future trends and spotting of anomalies or outliers. Beyond the emphasis on efficiency and scalability, we focus on simplifying or eliminating user intervention. Data mining algorithms must make the discovery task easy for average users. Unfortunately, many of the existing techniques require non-trivial user intervention at several steps of the process. Eliminating the requirement for user intervention should be a top priority in designing data mining methods. We show that multi-resolution analysis (i.e., examining the data at multiple resolutions or scales) is a powerful tool towards these goals. In particular, for spatial data we employ the correlation integral . For time series streams we use the wavelet transform and related techniques. Furthermore, we leverage tools from signal processing (again wavelets and, also, subspace tracking algorithms) to extract patterns from streams. Finally, we also employ compression principles coupled with multi-level partitionings to automatically cluster spatial data. The first two parts of this thesis focus on spatial mining methods. In the first part we examine homogeneous spatial data, where all points belong to one class. In the second part we examine heterogeneous spatial data, where the points may belong to two or more different classes (e.g., species, galaxy types, etc). Finally, in the third part we focus on numerical, time series streams and mining techniques for both single and multiple streams.", "year": "2005", "venue": "Parameter-free spatial and stream mining", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["Christos Faloutsos", "Spiros Papadimitriou"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a579c60b4bede9ea33c3"}}, {"index": "5390981d20f70186a0e04586", "title": "Online Latent Variable Detection in Sensor Networks", "abstract": "Sensor networks attract increasing interest, for a broad range of applications.

In this paper, we present a novel robust solution which detects high dimensional outliers based on user examples and tolerates incorrect inputs.

Technological advances have enabled the creation of huge data repositories. The need to turn such data into useful knowledge has fueled the development of data mining techniques. From a database perspective, the emphasis is often placed on scalability and efficiency. Practical approaches can afford only a single or, at best, a few passes over the data, i.e., the algorithmic complexity must be linear with respect to dataset size. Recently, in addition to the data warehouse model where data from multiple sources are integrated into a large store, the streaming model is emerging as an alternative data processing paradigm. Several applications produce a continuous stream of data (e.g., phone call detail records, web clickstreams or sensor measurements) that is too large to store in its entirety. Therefore, in stream mining we are allowed only a single pass over the data, without random access. Upon arrival of new observations, we have to incrementally update the data model. Furthermore, space complexity must be sublinear with respect to dataset size. In this thesis we develop spatial and stream mining tools for discovery of interesting patterns. These patterns summarise the data, enable forecasting of future trends and spotting of anomalies or outliers. Beyond the emphasis on efficiency and scalability, we focus on simplifying or eliminating user intervention. Data mining algorithms must make the discovery task easy for average users. Unfortunately, many of the existing techniques require non-trivial user intervention at several steps of the process. Eliminating the requirement for user intervention should be a top priority in designing data mining methods. We show that multi-resolution analysis (i.e., examining the data at multiple resolutions or scales) is a powerful tool towards these goals. In particular, for spatial data we employ the correlation integral . For time series streams we use the wavelet transform and related techniques. Furthermore, we leverage tools from signal processing (again wavelets and, also, subspace tracking algorithms) to extract patterns from streams. Finally, we also employ compression principles coupled with multi-level partitionings to automatically cluster spatial data. The first two parts of this thesis focus on spatial mining methods. In the first part we examine homogeneous spatial data, where all points belong to one class. In the second part we examine heterogeneous spatial data, where the points may belong to two or more different classes (e.g., species, galaxy types, etc). Finally, in the third part we focus on numerical, time series streams and mining techniques for both single and multiple streams.", "year": "2005", "venue": "Parameter-free spatial and stream mining", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["Christos Faloutsos", "Spiros Papadimitriou"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a64cc60b4bee2dd58bd6"}}, {"index": "5390981d20f70186a0e04586", "title": "Online Latent Variable Detection in Sensor Networks", "abstract": "Sensor networks attract increasing interest, for a broad range of applications.

We attempt to answer these questions in two parts. First, we answer questions targeted at applications : what patterns/properties of a graph are important for solving specific problems? Here, we investigate the propagation behavior of a computer virus over a network, and find a simple formula for the epidemic threshold (beyond which any viral outbreak might become an epidemic). We find an \u201cinformation survival threshold\u201d which determines whether, in a sensor or P2P network with failing nodes and links, a piece of information will survive or not. We also develop a scalable, parameter-free method for finding groups of \u201csimilar\u201d nodes in a graph, corresponding to homogeneous regions (or CrossAssociations) in the binary adjacency matrix of the graph. This can help navigate the structure of the graph, and find un-obvious patterns.

What are \"normal\" growth patterns in social, technological, and information networks? Many studies have discovered patterns in static graphs, identifying properties in a single snapshot of a large network, or in a very small number of snapshots; these include heavy tails for in- and out-degree distributions, communities, small-world phenomena, and others. However, given the lack of information about network evolution over long periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about trends over time.Here we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising phenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time, with the number of edges growing super-linearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average distance between nodes often shrinks over time, in contrast to the conventional wisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of the number of nodes (like O(log n) or O(log(log n)).Existing graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior, even at a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator, based on a \"forest fire\" spreading process, that has a simple, intuitive justification, requires very few parameters (like the \"flammability\" of nodes), and produces graphs exhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the present study.", "year": "2005", "venue": "Proceedings of the eleventh ACM SIGKDD international

Through automated methods, the described system identifies possible scaling methods; decides which attributes serve as inputs or outputs; and builds regression trees that quantify these relationships. While the experiments focus on the accuracy and complexity of these models, both of which one can attempt to quantitatively examine, the results also consider applicability towards the inherently more qualitative task of rule-based outlier or anomaly detection. The results demonstrate that the use of nonlinear axis scaling, even in an automated system, can provide significantly more accurate models compared to the unscaled case without proportionally higher complexity costs; and also can help reveal unusual tuples in which what is unusual is not any individual value, but the combination thereof.", "year": "2005", "venue": "Automated modeling and nonlinear axis scaling", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["Leejay Wu", "Christos Faloutsos"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a783c60b4bee2de42241"}}, {"index": "5390981d20f70186a0e04555", "title": "A Multiresolution Symbolic Representation of Time Series", "abstract": "Efficiently and accurately searching for similarities among time series and discovering interesting patterns is an important and non-trivial problem. In this paper, we introduce a new representation of time series, the Multiresolution Vector Quantized (MVQ) approximation, along with a new distance function. The novelty of MVQ is that it keeps both local and global information about the original time series in a hierarchical mechanism, processing the original time series at multiple resolutions. Moreover, the proposed representation is symbolic employing key subsequences and potentially allows the application of text-based retrieval techniques into the similarity analysis of time series. The proposed method is fast and scales linearly with the size of database and the dimensionality. Contrary to the vast majority in the literature that uses the Euclidean distance, MVQ uses a multi-resolution/hierarchical distance function. We performed experiments with real and synthetic data. The proposed distance function consistently outperforms all the major competitors (Euclidean, Dynamic Time Warping, Piecewise Aggregate Approximation) achieving up to 20% better precision/recall and clustering accuracy on the tested datasets.", "year": "2005", "venue": "ICDE '05 Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering", "citations": ["5390990f20f70186a0e0ffae", "539099a220f70186a0e18035", "539099a220f70186a0e1844f", "53909f2d20f70186a0e380af", "53909f2d20f70186a0e386df", "53909f8c20f70186a0e4006d", "5390a01420f70186a0e4759f", "5390a17720f70186a0e52456", "5390a25820f70186a0e5ed6b", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e7441d", "5390a6d920f70186a0e864e3", "5390a9a420f70186a0ea502b", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebd313", "5390ad8920f70186a0ebf305", "5390ad8920f70186a0ebfed4", "5390b29820f70186a0eea05e", "5390b29820f70186a0eeb080", "5390b2d720f70186a0eebfa7", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0ba82", "5390b7fe20f70186a0f26a83", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2b844", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2c0fc", "5390b9d520f70186a0f30d0e", "5390bda020f70186a0f45cd6", "5390bf1320f70186a0f503ec"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfacb3", "5390979920f70186a0dffa5f", "539087a520f70186a0d48a68", "539087c720f70186a0d56e12", "539087e120f70186a0d66422", "5390880720f70186a0d787b1", "5390880720f70186a0d79f0d", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2f2", "5390881820f70186a0d80e7e", "53908a5720f70186a0d9fbd9", "53908a5820f70186a0da11e6", "53908a7420f70186a0da4095", "53908a9620f70186a0da4742", "53908a9620f70186a0da4738", "53908a9620f70186a0da4cef", "53908ac620f70186a0da9b4a", "53908b0220f70186a0db1a61", "53908bcc20f70186a0dc611a", "53908bcc20f70186a0dc63ac", "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9ddc", "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9e84", "53908e0020f70186a0dd49b9", "5390962020f70186a0df4c77"], "authors": ["Vasileios Megalooikonomou", "Qiang Wang", "Guo Li", "Christos Faloutsos"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a794c60b4bee2de4f516"}}, {"index": "5390b2d720f70186a0eebf7c", "title": "Realistic, mathematically tractable graph generation and evolution, using kronecker multiplication", "abstract": "How can we generate realistic graphs?

Experiments on real and synthetic sequence data sets reveals that FTW is significantly faster than the best existing method, up to 222 times.", "year": "2005", "venue": "Proceedings of the twenty-fourth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems", "citations": ["539098dc20f70186a0e0dc61", "53909a0320f70186a0e2049d", "53909ed120f70186a0e2fcdc", "53909ed120f70186a0e315b5", "53909ee020f70186a0e31e6d", "53909fbc20f70186a0e41c16", "53909fca20f70186a0e45007", "5390a01420f70186a0e47f22", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c6e9", "5390a30b20f70186a0e69491", "5390a40520f70186a0e6ee9b", "5390a40520f70186a0e6fcd3", "5390a45520f70186a0e71be6", "5390a54620f70186a0e76b46", "5390a55520f70186a0e7a1df", "5390a72220f70186a0e89439", "5390a72220f70186a0e8af1a", "5390a79f20f70186a0e92336", "5390a8db20f70186a0e9d9de", "5390a8db20f70186a0e9da4e", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea6baa", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea7845", "5390aa0f20f70186a0ea8a7c", "5390aa0f20f70186a0ea8ab0", "5390ac1820f70186a0eb33a6", "5390ac5720f70186a0eb6124", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba440", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebcf96", "5390ad8920f70186a0ebfed4", "5390b04120f70186a0ed680c", "5390b13020f70186a0edd324", "5390b29820f70186a0eeae9f", "5390b2d720f70186a0eec0cc", "5390b2d720f70186a0eed546", "5390b44620f70186a0ef9926", "5390b52620f70186a0f02d7f", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e273", "5390b72d20f70186a0f2047c", "5390b7fe20f70186a0f26a83", "5390b9d520f70186a0f302c7", "5390b9d520f70186a0f312f3", "5390ba3820f70186a0f34ec6", "5390baa120f70186a0f37af5", "5390bae620f70186a0f3bfe1", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f3fb7e", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40a3b", "5390bda020f70186a0f45fe4", "5390bded20f70186a0f485ab", "5390bded20f70186a0f48dbe", "558b461f612c41e6b9d47ce4", "5390be6620f70186a0f4d295", "5390bed320f70186a0f4e369", "558bd2370cf2e30013db1721", "558b90ce612c6b62e5e8bb0f"], "references": ["5390879920f70186a0d406e0", "5390879920f70186a0d41e23", "539087ae20f70186a0d4e46c", "539087c320f70186a0d55bc1", "539087c720f70186a0d56e12", "539087e120f70186a0d65537", "539087e720f70186a0d69659", "539087f820f70186a0d72a90", "5390880220f70186a0d77f8e", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2f2", "5390881720f70186a0d7ffb1", "5390882d20f70186a0d8dac2", "53908a5720f70186a0d9fbd9", "53908a5720f70186a0da0132", "53908a7420f70186a0da453f", "53908a9620f70186a0da4738", "53908a9620f70186a0da4cef", "53908af920f70186a0db08b8", "53908b2a20f70186a0db8ffe", "53908bcc20f70186a0dc611a", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a04", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a985"], "authors": ["Yasushi Sakurai", "Masatoshi Yoshikawa", "Christos Faloutsos"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a7e7c60b4bee2de84e03"}}, {"index": "5390a80f20f70186a0e9758b", "title": "Fast estimation of fractal dimension and correlation integral on stream data", "abstract": "In this paper we give a very space-efficient, yet fast method for estimating the fractal dimensionality of the points in a data stream.

Lag correlations (and anti-correlations) are frequent, and very interesting in practice: For example, a decrease in interest rates typically precedes an increase in house sales by a few months; higher amounts of fluoride in the drinking water may lead to fewer dental cavities, some years later. Additional settings include network analysis, sensor monitoring, financial data analysis, and moving object tracking. Such data streams are often correlated (or anti-correlated), but with an unknown lag.We propose BRAID, a method to detect lag correlations between data streams. BRAID can handle data streams of semi-infinite length, incrementally, quickly, and with small resource consumption. We also provide a theoretical analysis, which, based on Nyquist's sampling theorem, shows that BRAID can estimate lag correlations with little, and often with no error at all. Our experiments on real and realistic data show that BRAID detects the correct lag perfectly most of the time (the largest relative error was about 1%); while it is up to 40,000 times faster than the naive implementation.", "year": "2005", "venue": "Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data", "citations": ["539098b820f70186a0e0ad9a", "53909f6920f70186a0e3ad47", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40d14", "5390a17720f70186a0e5243f", "5390a17720f70186a0e53c1d", "5390a1d420f70186a0e58690", "5390a30b20f70186a0e69af1", "5390a45520f70186a0e717ac", "5390a6b220f70186a0e86172", "5390a79f20f70186a0e922f9", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea6b82", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab836", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb1500", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba440", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebd091", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec5c84", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda9bb", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda9b3", "5390b1d220f70186a0ee15a8", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3fad", "5390b29820f70186a0ee8eb5", "5390b29820f70186a0eeae9f", "5390b2fc20f70186a0eeeb87", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1f86", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e253", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e274", "5390baa120f70186a0f38409", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40a3b", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40c48", "5390be6620f70186a0f4c367", "558b00bb612c41e6b9d400a9", "5390bfa220f70186a0f542ae", "558b8b4a612c6b62e5e8b2c4"], "references": ["539087c720f70186a0d56e12", "5390880720f70186a0d78761", "5390880720f70186a0d79fa2", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2f2", "5390881720f70186a0d804c5", "5390881820f70186a0d8117e", "5390881820f70186a0d816bd", "5390882c20f70186a0d8d165", "5390882d20f70186a0d8daa7", "5390882d20f70186a0d8daa6", "539088b920f70186a0d9149b", "53908a5720f70186a0d9fbd9", "53908a9620f70186a0da491a", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc86b", "53908d6520f70186a0dd19f8", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a0b", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a2d", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a0a", "5390958a20f70186a0def8e0", "5390958a20f70186a0df05da", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a985", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a981", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe52", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe3d", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe69", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401d1", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401a6", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401ab"], "authors": ["Yasushi Sakurai", "Spiros Papadimitriou", "Christos Faloutsos"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a823c60b4bee2deb7fc4"}}, {"index": "5390990f20f70186a0e0ff6f", "title": "Parameter-Free Spatial Data Mining Using MDL", "abstract": "Consider spatial data consisting of a set of binary features taking values over a collection of spatial extents (grid cells).

Or in Data Cubes, with product-branch-customer sales information? Matrix decompositions, like principal component analysis (PCA) and variants, are invaluable tools for mining, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, rule identification in numerous settings like streaming data, text, graphs, social networks and many more. However, they have only two orders, like author and keyword, in the above example.We propose to envision such higher order data as tensors,and tap the vast literature on the topic. However, these methods do not necessarily scale up, let alone operate on semi-infinite streams. Thus, we introduce the dynamic tensor analysis (DTA) method, and its variants. DTA provides a compact summary for high-order and high-dimensional data, and it also reveals the hidden correlations. Algorithmically, we designed DTA very carefully so that it is (a) scalable, (b) space efficient (it does not need to store the past) and (c) fully automatic with no need for user defined parameters.

Or in Data Cubes, with product-branch-customer sales information? Matrix decompositions, like principal component analysis (PCA) and variants, are invaluable tools for mining, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, rule identification in numerous settings like streaming data, text, graphs, social networks and many more. However, they have only two orders, like author and keyword, in the above example.We propose to envision such higher order data as tensors,and tap the vast literature on the topic. However, these methods do not necessarily scale up, let alone operate on semi-infinite streams. Thus, we introduce the dynamic tensor analysis (DTA) method, and its variants. DTA provides a compact summary for high-order and high-dimensional data, and it also reveals the hidden correlations. Algorithmically, we designed DTA very carefully so that it is (a) scalable, (b) space efficient (it does not need to store the past) and (c) fully automatic with no need for user defined parameters. Moreover, we propose STA, a streaming tensor analysis method, which provides a fast, streaming approximation to DTA.We implemented all our methods, and applied them in two real settings, namely, anomaly detection and multi-way latent semantic indexing.

In this paper we propose a novel method, 2-Level Fraud Spotting (2LFS), to model the techniques that fraudsters typically use to carry out fraudulent activities, and to detect fraudsters preemptively. Our key contributions are: (a) we mine user level features (e.g., number of transactions, average price of goods exchanged, etc.) to get an initial belief for spotting fraudsters, (b) we introduce network level features which capture the interactions between different users, and (c) we show how to combine both these features using a Belief Propagation algorithm over a Markov Random Field, and use it to detect suspicious patterns (e.g., unnaturally close-nit groups of people that trade mainly among themselves). Our algorithm scales linearly with the number of graph edges.

How to compute this score quickly, on huge, disk-resident, real graphs? Random walk with restart (RWR) provides a good relevance score between two nodes in a weighted graph, and it has been successfully used in numerous settings, like automatic captioning of images, generalizations to the \"connection subgraphs\", personalized PageRank, and many more. However, the straightforward implementations of RWR do not scale for large graphs, requiring either quadratic space and cubic pre-computation time, or slow response time on queries. We propose fast solutions to this problem. The heart of our approach is to exploit two important properties shared by many real graphs: (a) linear correlations and (b) blockwise, community-like structure. We exploit the linearity by using low-rank matrix approximation, and the community structure by graph partitioning, followed by the Sherman- Morrison lemma for matrix inversion. Experimental results on the Corel image and the DBLP dabasets demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve significant savings over the straightforward implementations: they can save several orders of magnitude in pre-computation and storage cost, and they achieve up to 150x speed up with 90%+ quality preservation.", "year": "2006", "venue": "ICDM '06 Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Data Mining", "citations": ["53909f2d20f70186a0e39532", "5390a01420f70186a0e46955", "5390a17720f70186a0e5242d", "5390a1d420f70186a0e56ca4", "5390a1d420f70186a0e57fa6", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d666", "5390a25820f70186a0e5e888", "5390a25820f70186a0e5eec1", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f0a2", "5390a54620f70186a0e77c04", "5390a54720f70186a0e788ee", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82f5e", "5390a72220f70186a0e89659", "5390a72220f70186a0e896ce", "5390a72220f70186a0e89717", "5390a72220f70186a0e896a3", "5390a72220f70186a0e8a770", "5390a79f20f70186a0e9232d", "5390a79f20f70186a0e923e5", "5390a7f620f70186a0e94efb", "5390a8db20f70186a0e9d9c3", "5390a9a420f70186a0ea49b2", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea5f5c", "5390ac1720f70186a0eb28b8", "5390aca820f70186a0eb8328", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba362", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba905", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebcf84", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec5418", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec67d6", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec84c6", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec886c", "5390aeba20f70186a0eca098", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecbd5d", "5390af8820f70186a0ecec8c", "5390afc920f70186a0ed21e2", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5bdf", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5de1", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5f72", "5390b04120f70186a0ed8705", "5390b04120f70186a0ed86cd", "5390b04120f70186a0ed86a1", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda92b", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda942", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda95d", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda9a5", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda9ac", "5390b13020f70186a0edd227", "5390b13020f70186a0edd8cf", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3f28", "5390b20120f70186a0ee51e1", "5390b20120f70186a0ee5a09", "5390b24320f70186a0ee66a4", "5390b29820f70186a0eeacff", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef4969", "5390b4c420f70186a0efeaa8", "5390b4c420f70186a0efed91", "5390b52620f70186a0f03371", "5390b56a20f70186a0f049fb", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0ba81", "5390b5ed20f70186a0f0d340", "5390b64020f70186a0f1aab6", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e254", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e31b", "5390b71120f70186a0f1fd01", "5390b72d20f70186a0f202ca", "5390b7fe20f70186a0f27364", "5390b86b20f70186a0f283e9", "5390b86b20f70186a0f28cb1", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a677", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a678", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2b92f", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2c0fa", "5390b9d520f70186a0f3179c", "5390b9d520f70186a0f31eaf", "5390b9d520f70186a0f31ee1", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f33538", "5390ba3820f70186a0f34ed2", "5390ba3820f70186a0f36913", "5390ba3820f70186a0f36912", "5390ba3820f70186a0f36aef", "5390ba3820f70186a0f36cfb", "5390baa120f70186a0f37f1d", "5390bae520f70186a0f3bbbe", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c359", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c461", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d12d", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d960", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f3fd34", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40076", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40b9c", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40bea", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f4110a", "5390bd1520f70186a0f432e5", "5390bd1520f70186a0f432f4", "5390bda020f70186a0f47ae1", "5390bda020f70186a0f47ad9", "558b0798612c41e6b9d40ca7", "558b1763612c41e6b9d42e99", "5390bfa220f70186a0f54284", "558b038c612c41e6b9d4062e", "558b48e7612c41e6b9d482af", "558afb11612c41e6b9d3f710", "558b02df612c41e6b9d404b2", "558b3042612c41e6b9d46278", "558b509c612c41e6b9d48fa7", "558fc260612c29c89cd7aef8", "558aec10612c41e6b9d3d91a", "559249940cf28b1a968ff6fe", "55323b7445cec66b6f9d9ee3", "55323b8245cec66b6f9da110", "55323bd245cec66b6f9daa77", "55323bfa45cec66b6f9daf42"], "references": [], "authors": ["Hanghang Tong", "Christos Faloutsos", "Jia-Yu Pan"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a75ec60b4bee2de24f5e"}}, {"index": "5390994d20f70186a0e11f47", "title": "An Adaptive Two-Phase Approach to WiFi Location Sensing", "abstract": "Environmental variations cause significant fluctuations in WiFi signals in the same location over time, rendering traditional RF-to-location pre-trained maps quickly obsolete.

The deeper, underlying question is subtle: how do we measure success?.We answer the above questions, and test our answers by thorough experiments on several, diverse datasets, spanning thousands nodes and edges. We consider several sampling methods, propose novel methods to check the goodness of sampling, and develop a set of scaling laws that describe relations between the properties of the original and the sample.In addition to the theoretical contributions, the practical conclusions from our work are: Sampling strategies based on edge selection do not perform well; simple uniform random node selection performs surprisingly well.

We focus on two problems: (1)\u00a0mining \"uni-modal patterns\" that summarize the characteristics of a data modality, and (2)\u00a0mining \"cross-modal correlations\" among multiple modalities. Uni-modal patterns such as \"news videos have static scenes and speech-like sounds\", and cross-modal correlations like \"the blue region at the upper part of a natural scene image is likely to be the 'sky'\", could provide insights on the multimedia content and have many applications. For uni-modal pattern discovery, we propose the method AutoSplit . AutoSplit provides a framework for mining meaningful \"independent components\" in multimedia data, and can find patterns in a wide variety of data modalities (e.g., video, audio, text, and time sequences). For example, in video clips, AutoSplit finds characteristic visual/auditory patterns, and can classify news and commercial clips with 81% accuracy. In time sequences like stock prices, AutoSplit finds hidden variables like \"general growth trend\" and \"Internet bubble\", and can detect outliers (e.g., lackluster stocks). Based on AutoSplit, we design a system, ViVo, for mining biomedical images. ViVo automatically constructs a visual vocabulary which is biologically meaningful and can classify 9 biological conditions with 84% accuracy. Moreover, ViVo supports data mining tasks such as highlighting biologically interesting image regions, for biomedical research. For cross-modal correlation discovery, we propose MAGIC, a graph-based framework for multimedia correlation mining. When applied to news video databases, MAGIC can identify relevant video shots and transcript words for event summarization. On the task of automatic image captioning, MAGIC achieves a relative improvement of 58% in captioning accuracy as compared to recent machine learning techniques.", "year": "2006", "venue": "Advanced tools for video and multimedia mining", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["Christos Faloutsos", "Howard Wactlar", "Jia-Yu Pan"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a77ec60b4bee2de3e885"}}, {"index": "539099a220f70186a0e17ce4", "title": "Evaluating the intrinsic dimension of evolving data streams", "abstract": "Data streams are fundamental in several data processing applications involving large amount of data generated continuously as a sequence of events. Frequently, such events are not stored, so the data is analyzed and queried as they arrive and discarded right away. In many applications these events are represented by a predetermined number of numerical attributes. Thus, without loss of generality, we can consider events as elements from a dimensional domain. A sequence of events in a data stream can be characterized by its intrinsic dimension, which in dimensional datasets is usually lower than the embedding dimensionality. As the intrinsic dimension can be used to improve the performance of algorithms handling dimensional data (specially query optimization) measuring it is relevant to improve data streams processing and analysis as well. Moreover, it can also be useful to forecast data behavior. Hence, we present an algorithm able to measure the intrinsic dimension of a data stream on the fly, following its continuously changing behavior. We also present experimental studies, using both real and synthetic data streams, showing that the results on well-understood datasets closely follow what is expected from the known behavior of the data.", "year": "2006", "venue": "Proceedings of the 2006 ACM symposium on Applied computing", "citations": ["5390a4cc20f70186a0e745a0", "5390b71120f70186a0f1ec6e"], "references": ["5390981d20f70186a0e0455d", "539087c320f70186a0d54c85", "539087eb20f70186a0d6a0c0", "5390882420f70186a0d89091", "5390893e20f70186a0d93026", "539089d320f70186a0d9bcfe", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc86b", "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9e57", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a25", "5390958a20f70186a0df05f0", "539095bb20f70186a0df25f6"], "authors": ["Elaine P.

In this paper, we propose a robust framework for determining a natural clustering of a given data set, based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle. The proposed framework, Robust Information-theoretic Clustering (RIC), is orthogonal to any known clustering algorithm: given a preliminary clustering, RIC purifies these clusters from noise, and adjusts the clusterings such that it simultaneously determines the most natural amount and shape (subspace) of the clusters. Our RIC method can be combined with any clustering technique ranging from K-means and K-medoids to advanced methods such as spectral clustering. In fact, RIC is even able to purify and improve an initial coarse clustering, even if we start with very simple methods such as grid-based space partitioning. Moreover, RIC scales well with the data set size.

Moreover, their applicability is limited to specific estimation tasks under certain distance metric. This paper develops the Power-method, a comprehensive technique applicable to a wide range of query optimization problems under both L\u9a74 and L2 metrics. The Power-method eliminates the local uniformity assumption and is, therefore, accurate even for datasets where existing approaches fail. Furthermore, it performs estimation by evaluating only one simple formula with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments confirm that the Power-method outperforms previous techniques in terms of accuracy and applicability to various optimization scenarios.", "year": "2006", "venue": "Geoinformatica", "citations": ["5390a05920f70186a0e49b9b", "5390a2e920f70186a0e68858", "5390b20120f70186a0ee5a6c"], "references": [], "authors": ["Yufei Tao", "Christos Faloutsos", "Dimitris Papadias"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a88cc60b4bee2df0f56b"}}, {"index": "539099ec20f70186a0e1cb72", "title": "GMine: a system for scalable, interactive graph visualization and mining", "abstract": "Several graph visualization tools exist. However, they are not able to handle large graphs, and/or they do not allow interaction. We are interested on large graphs, with hundreds of thousands of nodes. Such graphs bring two challenges: the first one is that any straightforward interactive manipulation will be prohibitively slow. The second one is sensory overload: even if we could plot and replot the graph quickly, the user would be overwhelmed with the vast volume of information because the screen would be too cluttered as nodes and edges overlap each other.Our GMine system addresses both these issues, by using summarization and multi-resolution. GMine offers multi-resolution graph exploration by partitioning a given graph into a hierarchy of communities-within-communities and storing it into a novel R-treelike structure which we name G-Tree. GMine offers summarization by implementing an innovative subgraph extraction algorithm and then visualizing its output.", "year": "2006", "venue": "VLDB '06 Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases", "citations": ["5390ab8820f70186a0eb1225", "5390ac1820f70186a0eb3346", "5390b1d220f70186a0ee1367", "5390b20120f70186a0ee4178", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e30e"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe0d", "539087f820f70186a0d714fb", "5390b29820f70186a0eeb054"], "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 F.

What sets InteMon apart from other cluster monitoring systems is its ability to automatically analyze correlations in the monitoring data in real time and alert administrators of potential anomalies.

In addition, we apply EMML framework to developing an effective and efficient solution to the multimodal data mining problem in a multimedia database. The main contributions include: (1) we have developed a new max margin learning approach - the enhanced max margin learning framework that is much more efficient in learning with a much faster convergence rate, which is verified in empirical evaluations; (2) we have applied this EMML approach to developing an effective and efficient solution to the multimodal data mining problem that is highly scalable in the sense that the query response time is independent of the database scale, allowing facilitating a multimodal data mining querying to a very large scale multimedia database,and excelling many existing multimodal data mining methods in the literature that do not scale up at all; this advantage is also supported through the complexity analysis as well as empirical evaluations against a state-of-the-art multimodal data mining method from the literature.

In addition, we apply EMML framework to developing an effective and efficient solution to the multimodal data mining problem in a multimedia database. The main contributions include: (1) we have developed a new max margin learning approach - the enhanced max margin learning framework that is much more efficient in learning with a much faster convergence rate, which is verified in empirical evaluations; (2) we have applied this EMML approach to developing an effective and efficient solution to the multimodal data mining problem that is highly scalable in the sense that the query response time is independent of the database scale, allowing facilitating a multimodal data mining querying to a very large scale multimedia database,and excelling many existing multimodal data mining methods in the literature that do not scale up at all; this advantage is also supported through the complexity analysis as well as empirical evaluations against a state-of-the-art multimodal data mining method from the literature.

This paper describes the design and implementation of NetProbe, a system that we propose for solving this problem. NetProbe models auction users and transactions as a Markov Random Field tuned to detect the suspicious patterns that fraudsters create, and employs a Belief Propagation mechanism to detect likely fraudsters. Our experiments show that NetProbe is both efficient and effective for fraud detection. We report experiments on synthetic graphs with as many as 7,000 nodes and 30,000 edges, where NetProbe was able to spot fraudulent nodes with over 90% precision and recall, within a matter of seconds. We also report experiments on a real dataset crawled from eBay, with nearly 700,000 transactions between more than 66,000users, where NetProbe was highly effective at unearthing hidden networks of fraudsters, within a realistic response time of about 6 minutes. For scenarios where the underlying data is dynamic in nature, we propose IncrementalNetProbe, which is an approximate, but fast, variant of NetProbe. Our experiments prove that Incremental NetProbe executes nearly doubly fast as compared to NetProbe, while retaining over 99% of its accuracy.", "year": "2007", "venue": "Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web", "citations": ["5390a05920f70186a0e49bad", "5390a17720f70186a0e5244b", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75067", "5390a54620f70186a0e77c7c", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7f69b", "5390a63c20f70186a0e81cbf", "5390a7f520f70186a0e93833", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea1081", "5390aa7620f70186a0eac1aa", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec5f07", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec84c8", "5390aefc20f70186a0ece0a8", "5390af8920f70186a0ed0a22", "5390af8920f70186a0ed0ac0", "5390afc920f70186a0ed1512", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed57c1", "5390b13020f70186a0edd8cf", "5390b48420f70186a0efbe4a", "5390b48420f70186a0efbe49", "5390b4c320f70186a0efd47b", "5390b4c420f70186a0efe9f1", "5390b61e20f70186a0f14ba7", "5390b63320f70186a0f16f81", "5390b68720f70186a0f1bdb5", "5390b71120f70186a0f1dbc3", "5390b72d20f70186a0f2054d", "5390b72e20f70186a0f220a5", "5390b78a20f70186a0f22e35", "5390b7fe20f70186a0f26aba", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a72e", "5390b95420f70186a0f2dbab", "5390b9d520f70186a0f31ef1", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f32948", "5390ba3820f70186a0f36abf", "5390bae520f70186a0f3b788", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d0fb", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d0db", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d2b6", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d347", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d3c1", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f3fae3", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40a2b", "5390bed320f70186a0f4e375", "558af23d612c41e6b9d3e3d2", "558b8c46612c6b62e5e8b45c", "558b884e612c6b62e5e8ad76", "558b7796612c6b62e5e893c6", "55323bd245cec66b6f9daa77"], "references": ["5390979920f70186a0dffdb3", "5390985d20f70186a0e06e9d", "539098b820f70186a0e0a85f", "539098b820f70186a0e0a852", "539098b820f70186a0e0a848", "539099b320f70186a0e19a68", "539087ef20f70186a0d6e1ac", "539087f820f70186a0d71b96", "5390880720f70186a0d79ffb", "53908a7420f70186a0da467f", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbd0ce", "53908bde20f70186a0dc94c1", "5390958920f70186a0dee019", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401be", "5390b29820f70186a0ee97c4"], "authors": ["Shashank Pandit", "Duen Horng Chau", "Samuel Wang", "Christos Faloutsos"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a685c60b4bee2dd864a4"}}, {"index": "53909fbd20f70186a0e42234", "title": "Mining large time-evolving data using matrix and tensor tools", "abstract": "", "year": "2007", "venue": "Proceedings of the 13th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["Christos Faloutsos", "Tamara G.

In such a setting, we want to find subgraphs that match a user query pattern. For example, a \"star\" query would be, \"find a CEO who has strong interactions with a Manager, a Lawyer,and an Accountant, or another structure as close to that as possible\". Similarly, a \"loop\" query could help spot a money laundering ring. Traditional SQL-based methods, as well as more recent graph indexing methods, will return no answer when an exact match does not exist. This is the first main feature of our method. It can find exact-, as well as near-matches, and it will present them to the user in our proposed \"goodness\" order. For example, our method tolerates indirect paths between, say, the \"CEO\" and the \"Accountant\" of the above sample query, when direct paths don't exist. Its second feature is scalability. In general, if the query has nq nodes and the data graph has n nodes, the problem needs polynomial time complexity O(n n q), which is prohibitive. Our G-Ray (\"Graph X-Ray\") method finds high-quality subgraphs in time linear on the size of the data graph. Experimental results on the DLBP author-publication graph (with 356K nodes and 1.9M edges) illustrate both the effectiveness and scalability of our approach.

The questions are how to find patterns (main trends) incrementally; or how to efficiently update the old patterns when new data arrive; or how to utilize the patterns to solve other problems such as anomaly detection? As examples, (1)\u00a0a sensor network monitors a large number of distributed streams (such as temperature and humidity); (2)\u00a0network forensics monitor the Internet communication patterns to identify attacks; (3)\u00a0cluster monitoring examines the system behaviors of a number of machines for potential failures; (4)\u00a0social network analysis monitors a dynamic graph for communities and abnormal individuals; (5)\u00a0financial fraud detection tries to find fraudulent activities from a large number of transactions. We first investigate a powerful data model, tensor stream (TS), where there is one tensor per timestamp. To capture diverse data formats, we have a zero-order TS for a single time-series (e.g., the stock price for Google over time), a first-order TS for multiple time-series (sensor measurement streams), a second-order TS for a matrix (graphs), and a high-order TS for a multiarray (Internet communication network, source-destination-port). Second, we develop different online algorithms on TS: (1)\u00a0the centralized and distributed SPIRIT for mining a 1st-order TS, as well as its extensions for local correlation function and privacy preservation; (2)\u00a0the compact matrix decomposition (CMD) and GraphScope for a 2nd-order TS; (3)\u00a0the dynamic tensor analysis (DTA), streaming tensor analysis (STA) and window-based tensor analysis (WTA) for a high-order TS. All the techniques are extensively evaluated for real applications such as network forensics, cluster monitoring. In particular, this CMD achieves orders of magnitude improvements in space and time over the previous state of the art, and identifies interesting anomalies. GraphScope detects interesting communities and change-points on several time-evolving graphs such as Enron email graph and another network traffic flow graph. DTA, STA and WTA are all online methods for higherorder data that scale well with time, provide fundamental tradeoffs with each other, which have also been applied to a number of applications, such as social network community tracking, anomaly detection in data centers and network traffic monitoring.", "year": "2007", "venue": "Incremental pattern discovery on streams, graphs and tensors", "citations": ["5390b00c20f70186a0ed4279"], "references": [], "authors": ["Christos Faloutsos", "Jimeng Sun"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a738c60b4bee2de08a0a"}}, {"index": "53909ed120f70186a0e3055f", "title": "A fast and effective method to find correlations among attributes in databases", "abstract": "The problem of identifying meaningful patterns in a database lies at the very heart of data mining. A core objective of data mining processes is the recognition of inter-attribute correlations. Not only are correlations necessary for predictions and classifications --- since rules would fail in the absence of pattern --- but also the identification of groups of mutually correlated attributes expedites the selection of a representative subset of attributes, from which existing mappings allow others to be derived. In this paper, we describe a scalable, effective algorithm to identify groups of correlated attributes. This algorithm can handle non-linear correlations between attributes, and is not restricted to a specific family of mapping functions, such as the set of polynomials. We show the results of our evaluation of the algorithm applied to synthetic and real world datasets, and demonstrate that it is able to spot the correlated attributes. Moreover, the execution time of the proposed technique is linear on the number of elements and of correlations in the dataset.", "year": "2007", "venue": "Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery", "citations": ["5390a37f20f70186a0e6c22e", "5390b9d520f70186a0f3251f", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d244", "5390bded20f70186a0f4881a"], "references": ["5390975920f70186a0dfe3b2", "5390980720f70186a0e0332c", "539098b820f70186a0e09bba", "539087aa20f70186a0d4ba2b", "539087ae20f70186a0d4df1b", "539087c320f70186a0d56138", "539087dd20f70186a0d644d1", "539087e720f70186a0d6774c", "539087e720f70186a0d6828c", "539087e720f70186a0d6965b", "539087eb20f70186a0d6a0c0", "539087ef20f70186a0d6db37", "539087fe20f70186a0d7392f", "5390880220f70186a0d75efd", "5390880720f70186a0d7a76c", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2ff", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2f2", "5390881720f70186a0d804ce", "5390881820f70186a0d8115d", "5390882d20f70186a0d8e410", "5390893e20f70186a0d93026", "539089bb20f70186a0d9940b", "539089d220f70186a0d9ab5b", "539089d220f70186a0d9ab5c", "539089d220f70186a0d9abb1", "539089d320f70186a0d9bcfe", "53908a7420f70186a0da3937", "53908a9620f70186a0da4c55", "53908a9620f70186a0da4cfa", "53908af920f70186a0db01aa", "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9e57", "53908e0020f70186a0dd4313", "539095bb20f70186a0df25f6", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecb603", "5390b64020f70186a0f198ca"], "authors": ["Elaine P.

A naive approach to fitting would take super-exponential time. In contrast, KronFit takes linear time, by exploiting the structure of Kronecker product and by using sampling. Experiments on large real and synthetic graphs show that KronFit indeed mimics very well the patterns found in the target graphs.

The embedding dimension (i.e., the number of attributes of the dataset) usually overestimates the actual contribution of the attributes to the main characteristics of the data, as the typical assumption of uniform distribution and independence between attributes usually does not hold. In fact, due to dependencies and attribute correlations, real data are typically skewed and exhibit intrinsic dimensionality much lower than the embedding dimension. Similarly, the intrinsic dimension can also be applied to improve data stream processing and analysis. Data streams are generated as sequences of events represented by a predetermined number of numerical attributes. Thus, without loss of generality, we can consider events as elements from a dimensional domain. This paper presents a fast, linear algorithm to measure the intrinsic dimension of a data stream on the fly, following its continuously changing behavior. Experimental studies show that the intrinsic dimension can be used to analyze attribute correlations. The results on well-understood datasets closely follow what is expected from the known behavior of the data.", "year": "2007", "venue": "New Generation Computing", "citations": ["5390b5df20f70186a0f0b3fd", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d244"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfaca9", "5390972920f70186a0dfacab", "5390972920f70186a0dfac96", "5390972920f70186a0dfbe35", "5390979920f70186a0dffa52", "5390980720f70186a0e03a46", "5390981d20f70186a0e0450d", "5390981d20f70186a0e0455d", "5390985d20f70186a0e06e60", "5390985d20f70186a0e0705d", "539099a220f70186a0e17ce4", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401b7", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401aa", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401a9", "53909f8c20f70186a0e4019d", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401a6", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401d5", "539087c320f70186a0d54c85", "539087eb20f70186a0d6a0c0", "5390880220f70186a0d75efd", "5390880220f70186a0d75f10", "5390880720f70186a0d7a76c", "5390881720f70186a0d804ce", "5390882420f70186a0d89091", "5390893e20f70186a0d93026", "539089d220f70186a0d9aaf9", "539089d220f70186a0d9abb1", "539089d320f70186a0d9bcfe", "53908a9620f70186a0da4cfa", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc86e", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc86b", "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9e57", "53908cde20f70186a0dce1ed", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a25", "5390958a20f70186a0def8e0", "539095ba20f70186a0df096f", "5390958a20f70186a0df05f0", "5390958a20f70186a0df05da", "539095bb20f70186a0df25f6", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef2cd5", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef2cbd", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef5df2", "539089ab20f70186a0d96ba4", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc917"], "authors": ["Elaine P.

Is it possible to construct multilinear probabilistic graphical models for tensorformat data to conduct probabilistic inference, e.g., model selection? This paper provides a positive answer based on the proposed decoupled probabilistic model by developing the probabilistic tensor analysis(PTA), which selects suitable model for tensorformat data modeling based on Akaike information criterion(AIC) and Bayesian information criterion(BIC).

Or, which blogs should we read to avoid missing important stories?. These seemingly different problems share common structure: Outbreak detection can be modeled as selecting nodes (sensor locations, blogs) in a network, in order to detect the spreading of a virus or information asquickly as possible. We present a general methodology for near optimal sensor placement in these and related problems. We demonstrate that many realistic outbreak detection objectives (e.g., detection likelihood, population affected) exhibit the property of \"submodularity\". We exploit submodularity to develop an efficient algorithm that scales to large problems, achieving near optimal placements, while being 700 times faster than a simple greedy algorithm. We also derive online bounds on the quality of the placements obtained by any algorithm. Our algorithms and bounds also handle cases where nodes (sensor locations, blogs) have different costs. We evaluate our approach on several large real-world problems,including a model of a water distribution network from the EPA, andreal blog data. The obtained sensor placements are provably near optimal, providing a constant fraction of the optimal solution. We show that the approach scales, achieving speedups and savings in storage of several orders of magnitude. We also show how the approach leads to deeper insights in both applications, answering multicriteria trade-off, cost-sensitivity and generalization questions.", "year": "2007", "venue": "Proceedings

To show how this works in practice, we describe our implementation of the crawlers for an online auction website. The crawlers work independently, therefore the failing of one crawler does not affect the others at all. The framework ensures that no redundant crawling would occur.

However, given the lack of information about network evolution over long periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about trends over time. Here we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising phenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time with the number of edges growing superlinearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average distance between nodes often shrinks over time in contrast to the conventional wisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of the number of nodes (like O(log n) or O(log(log n)). Existing graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior even at a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator, based on a forest fire spreading process that has a simple, intuitive justification, requires very few parameters (like the flammability of nodes), and produces graphs exhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the present study. We also notice that the forest fire model exhibits a sharp transition between sparse graphs and graphs that are densifying. Graphs with decreasing distance between the nodes are generated around this transition point. Last, we analyze the connection between the temporal evolution of the degree distribution and densification of a graph. We find that the two are fundamentally related.

As most clustering algorithms were designed with certain assumptions (Gaussianity), they often require the user to give input parameters, and are sensitive to noise. In this article, we propose a robust framework for determining a natural clustering of a given dataset, based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle. The proposed framework, robust information-theoretic clustering (RIC), is orthogonal to any known clustering algorithm: Given a preliminary clustering, RIC purifies these clusters from noise, and adjusts the clusterings such that it simultaneously determines the most natural amount and shape (subspace) of the clusters. Our RIC method can be combined with any clustering technique ranging from K-means and K-medoids to advanced methods such as spectral clustering. In fact, RIC is even able to purify and improve an initial coarse clustering, even if we start with very simple methods. In an extension, we propose a fully automatic stand-alone clustering method and efficiency improvements. RIC scales well with the dataset size.

With half a billion active users, online social networks have attained critical mass and triggered intense research interest in collaborative systems and the analysis of the structure and properties of online communities. In creating WOSN 2008, we had one overarching goal in mind: To bring together researchers and practitioners across various disciplines in order to discuss the challenges and the important questions posed by the emerging online social applications, and advance the state of the art in our understanding of social networks. We believe that the WOSN 2008 program realizes this goal to a large extent by covering several aspects of online social networks, including those of network and system architecture design that are of natural interest to the SIGCOMM community. In this first workshop on online social networks, we received a total of 40 submissions from universities, academic institutions and the industry. All papers went through a rigorous reviewing process with the majority of papers receiving 3 or more reviews by TPC members and external reviewers. Reviewing was followed by email discussion of controversial papers. Of the 40 papers submitted, a total of 14 were accepted for publication. Specifically, the workshop program consists of four sessions. The first session of WOSN 2008 is concerned with the impact of social networks on voting, advertising and the flow of information within the social graph. The \"face of social networks\" is portrayed in the second session of the workshop, where a series of characterization papers examine different properties of online social networks, ranging from structural properties of the social graph to user privacy concerns and user behaviors as these are observed in the online social applications. The third session, titled \"who do you trust?\", explores efficient system design and architectures for sharing content in online social networks. Mobile social networks and social mobility is the subject of the fourth session, where algorithms for opportunistic gossiping and characteristics of human mobility are presented.", "year": "2008", "venue": "ACM SIGCOMM 2008 Conference", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["Christos Faloutsos", "Thomas Karagiannis", "Pablo Rodriguez"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a570c60b4bede9e9e042"}}, {"index": "5390a17720f70186a0e52453", "title": "Mobile call graphs: beyond power-law and lognormal distributions", "abstract": "We analyze a massive social network, gathered from the records of a large mobile phone operator, with more than a million users and tens of millions of calls. We examine the distributions of the number of phone calls per customer; the total talk minutes per customer; and the distinct number of calling partners per customer. We find that these distributions are skewed, and that they significantly deviate from what would be expected by power-law and lognormal distributions. To analyze our observed distributions (of number of calls, distinct call partners, and total talk time), we propose PowerTrack , a method which fits a lesser known but more suitable distribution, namely the Double Pareto LogNormal (DPLN) distribution, to our data and track its parameters over time. Using PowerTrack , we find that our graph changes over time in a way consistent with a generative process that naturally results in the DPLN distributions we observe. Furthermore, we show that this generative process lends itself to a natural and appealing social wealth interpretation in the context of social networks such as ours. We discuss the application of those results to our model and to forecasting.", "year": "2008", "venue": "Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390a4cc20f70186a0e7500d", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7e5ed", "5390a6d920f70186a0e884b0", "5390a6d920f70186a0e8860e", "5390aa7620f70186a0eaa42b", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe3f6", "5390af8920f70186a0ecfee6", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5658", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5f80", "5390b13020f70186a0edccf7", "5390b1d220f70186a0ee12b4", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef565b", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef687d", "5390b44620f70186a0ef8c6d", "5390b71120f70186a0f1ec9f", "5390b9d520f70186a0f319ae", "5390bed320f70186a0f4e312", "558fca33612c29c89cd7b1c0", "558b4f36612c41e6b9d48d71", "55924e810cf26384af04a3df"], "references": ["5390981d20f70186a0e064e9", "53909a0320f70186a0e20469", "539087f820f70186a0d71f36", "5390880220f70186a0d78472", "5390881720f70186a0d7fd44", "5390881720f70186a0d804bd", "53908a7420f70186a0da467f", "53908b1820f70186a0db55fe", "5390a74e20f70186a0e8b63f"], "authors": ["Mukund Seshadri", "Sridhar Machiraju", "Ashwin Sridharan", "Jean Bolot", "Christos Faloutsos", "Jure Leskove"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a592c60b4bede9eb568b"}}, {"index": "5390a17720f70186a0e5245d", "title": "Colibri: fast mining of large static and dynamic graphs", "abstract": "Low-rank approximations of the adjacency matrix of a graph are essential in finding patterns (such as communities) and detecting anomalies. Additionally, it is desirable to track the low-rank structure as the graph evolves over time, efficiently and within limited storage. Real graphs typically have thousands or millions of nodes, but are usually very sparse. However, standard decompositions such as SVD do not preserve sparsity. This has led to the development of methods such as CUR and CMD, which seek a non-orthogonal basis by sampling the columns and/or rows of the sparse matrix. However, these approaches will typically produce overcomplete bases, which wastes both space and time. In this paper we propose the family of Colibri methods to deal with these challenges. Our version for static graphs, Colibri-S, iteratively finds a non-redundant basis and we prove that it has no loss of accuracy compared to the best competitors (CUR and CMD), while achieving significant savings in space and time: on real data, Colibri-S requires much less space and is orders of magnitude faster (in proportion to the square of the number of non-redundant columns). Additionally, we propose an efficient update algorithm for dynamic, time-evolving graphs, Colibri-D. Our evaluation on a large, real network traffic dataset shows that Colibri-D is over 100 times faster than the best published competitor (CMD).", "year": "2008", "venue": "Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390a4cc20f70186a0e7504a", "5390a63c20f70186a0e8286d", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe3e8", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec67d5", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1285", "5390b4c420f70186a0efe320", "5390b63320f70186a0f16959", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2873c", "5390b95520f70186a0f2f679", "5390b9d520f70186a0f308a4", "5390baa120f70186a0f38945", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c525", "5390bfa220f70186a0f5370f", "5390bfa220f70186a0f542d1", "558ad537612c41e6b9d3b1b7", "558adcf1612c41e6b9d3bd7a"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe4e", "539098b820f70186a0e0a843", "539098b820f70186a0e0ad9b", "539098b820f70186a0e0ad9a", "5390990f20f70186a0e0ff78", "539099a220f70186a0e16d75", "539099a220f70186a0e16d77", "539099b320f70186a0e19a0b", "539099b320f70186a0e19a2c", "53909e7c20f70186a0e2c550", "53909f2d20f70186a0e394f7", "53909f2d20f70186a0e3952d", "5390a01420f70186a0e48477", "5390879920f70186a0d40653", "539087e720f70186a0d6965b", "539087e720f70186a0d69793", "539087f820f70186a0d71f36", "5390880220f70186a0d78472", "539089bb20f70186a0d9981f", "53908b9320f70186a0dc07e3", "5390958a20f70186a0df05f1", "5390958a20f70186a0df05c6"], "authors": ["Hanghang Tong", "Spiros Papadimitriou", "Jimeng Sun", "Philip S.

With half a billion active users, online social networks have attained critical mass and triggered intense research interest in collaborative systems and the analysis of the structure and properties of online communities. In creating WOSN 2008, we had one overarching goal in mind: To bring together researchers and practitioners across various disciplines in order to discuss the challenges and the important questions posed by the emerging online social applications, and advance the state of the art in our understanding of social networks. We believe that the WOSN 2008 program realizes this goal to a large extent by covering several aspects of online social networks, including those of network and system architecture design that are of natural interest to the SIGCOMM community. In this first workshop on online social networks, we received a total of 40 submissions from universities, academic institutions and the industry. All papers went through a rigorous reviewing process with the majority of papers receiving 3 or more reviews by TPC members and external reviewers. Reviewing was followed by email discussion of controversial papers. Of the 40 papers submitted, a total of 14 were accepted for publication. Specifically, the workshop program consists of four sessions. The first session of WOSN 2008 is concerned with the impact of social networks on voting, advertising and the flow of information within the social graph. The \"face of social networks\" is portrayed in the second session of the workshop, where a series of characterization papers examine different properties of online social networks, ranging from structural properties of the social graph to user privacy concerns and user behaviors as these are observed in the online social applications. The third session, titled \"who do you trust?\", explores efficient system design and architectures for sharing content in online social networks. Mobile social networks and social mobility is the subject of the fourth session, where algorithms for opportunistic gossiping and characteristics of human mobility are presented.", "year": "2008", "venue": "ACM SIGCOMM 2008 Conference", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["Christos Faloutsos", "Thomas Karagiannis", "Pablo Rodriguez"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a646c60b4bee2dd53855"}}, {"index": "5390a17720f70186a0e52453", "title": "Mobile call graphs: beyond power-law and lognormal distributions", "abstract": "We analyze a massive social network, gathered from the records of a large mobile phone operator, with more than a million users and tens of millions of calls. We examine the distributions of the number of phone calls per customer; the total talk minutes per customer; and the distinct number of calling partners per customer. We find that these distributions are skewed, and that they significantly deviate from what would be expected by power-law and lognormal distributions. To analyze our observed distributions (of number of calls, distinct call partners, and total talk time), we propose PowerTrack , a method which fits a lesser known but more suitable distribution, namely the Double Pareto LogNormal (DPLN) distribution, to our data and track its parameters over time. Using PowerTrack , we find that our graph changes over time in a way consistent with a generative process that naturally results in the DPLN distributions we observe. Furthermore, we show that this generative process lends itself to a natural and appealing social wealth interpretation in the context of social networks such as ours. We discuss the application of those results to our model and to forecasting.", "year": "2008", "venue": "Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390a4cc20f70186a0e7500d", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7e5ed", "5390a6d920f70186a0e884b0", "5390a6d920f70186a0e8860e", "5390aa7620f70186a0eaa42b", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe3f6", "5390af8920f70186a0ecfee6", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5658", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5f80", "5390b13020f70186a0edccf7", "5390b1d220f70186a0ee12b4", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef565b", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef687d", "5390b44620f70186a0ef8c6d", "5390b71120f70186a0f1ec9f", "5390b9d520f70186a0f319ae", "5390bed320f70186a0f4e312", "558fca33612c29c89cd7b1c0", "558b4f36612c41e6b9d48d71", "55924e810cf26384af04a3df"], "references": ["5390981d20f70186a0e064e9", "53909a0320f70186a0e20469", "539087f820f70186a0d71f36", "5390880220f70186a0d78472", "5390881720f70186a0d7fd44", "5390881720f70186a0d804bd", "53908a7420f70186a0da467f", "53908b1820f70186a0db55fe", "5390a74e20f70186a0e8b63f"], "authors": ["Mukund Seshadri", "Sridhar Machiraju", "Ashwin Sridharan", "Jean Bolot", "Christos Faloutsos", "Jure Leskove"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a662c60b4bee2dd6ae9e"}}, {"index": "5390a17720f70186a0e5245d", "title": "Colibri: fast mining of large static and dynamic graphs", "abstract": "Low-rank approximations of the adjacency matrix of a graph are essential in finding patterns (such as communities) and detecting anomalies. Additionally, it is desirable to track the low-rank structure as the graph evolves over time, efficiently and within limited storage. Real graphs typically have thousands or millions of nodes, but are usually very sparse. However, standard decompositions such as SVD do not preserve sparsity. This has led to the development of methods such as CUR and CMD, which seek a non-orthogonal basis by sampling the columns and/or rows of the sparse matrix. However, these approaches will typically produce overcomplete bases, which wastes both space and time. In this paper we propose the family of Colibri methods to deal with these challenges. Our version for static graphs, Colibri-S, iteratively finds a non-redundant basis and we prove that it has no loss of accuracy compared to the best competitors (CUR and CMD), while achieving significant savings in space and time: on real data, Colibri-S requires much less space and is orders of magnitude faster (in proportion to the square of the number of non-redundant columns). Additionally, we propose an efficient update algorithm for dynamic, time-evolving graphs, Colibri-D. Our evaluation on a large, real network traffic dataset shows that Colibri-D is over 100 times faster than the best published competitor (CMD).", "year": "2008", "venue": "Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390a4cc20f70186a0e7504a", "5390a63c20f70186a0e8286d", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe3e8", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec67d5", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1285", "5390b4c420f70186a0efe320", "5390b63320f70186a0f16959", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2873c", "5390b95520f70186a0f2f679", "5390b9d520f70186a0f308a4", "5390baa120f70186a0f38945", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c525", "5390bfa220f70186a0f5370f", "5390bfa220f70186a0f542d1", "558ad537612c41e6b9d3b1b7", "558adcf1612c41e6b9d3bd7a"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe4e", "539098b820f70186a0e0a843", "539098b820f70186a0e0ad9b", "539098b820f70186a0e0ad9a", "5390990f20f70186a0e0ff78", "539099a220f70186a0e16d75", "539099a220f70186a0e16d77", "539099b320f70186a0e19a0b", "539099b320f70186a0e19a2c", "53909e7c20f70186a0e2c550", "53909f2d20f70186a0e394f7", "53909f2d20f70186a0e3952d", "5390a01420f70186a0e48477", "5390879920f70186a0d40653", "539087e720f70186a0d6965b", "539087e720f70186a0d69793", "539087f820f70186a0d71f36", "5390880220f70186a0d78472", "539089bb20f70186a0d9981f", "53908b9320f70186a0dc07e3", "5390958a20f70186a0df05f1", "5390958a20f70186a0df05c6"], "authors": ["Hanghang Tong", "Spiros Papadimitriou", "Jimeng Sun", "Philip S.

New algorithms are required in order to recover complexes with other types of topological structure. Results: We present an algorithm for inferring protein complexes from weighted interaction graphs. By using graph topological patterns and biological properties as features, we model each complex subgraph by a probabilistic Bayesian network (BN). We use a training set of known complexes to learn the parameters of this BN model. The log-likelihood ratio derived from the BN is then used to score subgraphs in the protein interaction graph and identify new complexes. We applied our method to protein interaction data in yeast. As we show our algorithm achieved a considerable improvement over clique based algorithms in terms of its ability to recover known complexes. We discuss some of the new complexes predicted by our algorithm and determine that they likely represent true complexes.

Most existing clustering methods are restricted to the Gaussian cluster model and are very sensitive to noise. If the cluster content follows a non-Gaussian distribution and/or the data set contains a few outliers belonging to no cluster, then the computed data distribution does not match well the true data distribution, or an unnaturally high number of clusters is required to represent the true data distribution of the data set. In this paper we propose OCI (Outlier-robust Clustering using Independent Components), a clustering method which overcomes these problems by (1) applying the exponential power distribution (EPD) as cluster model which is a generalization of Gaussian, uniform, Laplacian and many other distribution functions, (2) applying the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for both determining the main directions inside a cluster as well as finding split planes in a top-down clustering approach, and (3) defining an efficient and effective filter for outliers, based on EPD and ICA.

We answer these questions by developing a nonlinear dynamical system (NLDS) that accurately models viral propagation in any arbitrary network, including real and synthesized network graphs.

Techniques for statistical relational learning have been shown to perform well on network classification tasks by exploiting dependencies between class labels of neighboring nodes. However, relational classifiers can fail when unlabeled nodes have too few labeled neighbors to support learning (during training phase) and/or inference (during testing phase). This situation arises in real-world problems when observed labels are sparse. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to within-network classification that combines aspects of statistical relational learning and semi-supervised learning to improve classification performance in sparse networks. Our approach works by adding \"ghost edges\" to a network, which enable the flow of information from labeled to unlabeled nodes. Through experiments on real-world data sets, we demonstrate that our approach performs well across a range of conditions where existing approaches, such as collective classification and semi-supervised learning, fail. On all tasks, our approach improves area under the ROC curve (AUC) by up to 15 points over existing approaches.

Events could be meetings with one or more persons and one or more agenda items at zero or more locations (e.g., teleconferences), or they could be publications with authors, keywords, publishers, etc. In such settings, we want to find time stamps that look similar to each other and group them; we also want to find anomalies. In addition, we want our approach to provide interpretations of the clusters and anomalies by annotating them. Furthermore, we want our approach to automatically find the right time-granularity in which to do analysis. Lastly, we want fast, scalable algorithms for all these problems. We address the above challenges through two main ideas. The first (T3) is to turn the problem into a graph analysis problem, by carefully treating each time stamp as a node in a graph. This viewpoint brings to bear the vast machinery of graph analysis methods (PageRank, graph partitioning, proximity analysis, and CenterPiece Subgraphs, to name a few). Thus, T3 can automatically group the time stamps into meaningful clusters and spot anomalies. Moreover, it can select representative events/persons/locations for each cluster and each anomaly, as their interpretations.

However, the straightforward implementations of RWR do not scale for large graphs, requiring either quadratic space and cubic pre-computation time, or slow response time on queries. We propose fast solutions to this problem. The heart of our approach is to exploit two important properties shared by many real graphs: (a) linear correlations and (b) block-wise, community-like structure. We exploit the linearity by using low-rank matrix approximation, and the community structure by graph partitioning, followed by the Sherman\u2013Morrison lemma for matrix inversion.

We propose to envision such higher-order data as tensors, and tap the vast literature on the topic. However, these methods do not necessarily scale up, let alone operate on semi-infinite streams. Thus, we introduce a general framework, incremental tensor analysis (ITA), which efficiently computes a compact summary for high-order and high-dimensional data, and also reveals the hidden correlations.

We study numerous diverse, real graphs (citation networks, networks in social media, internet traffic, and others); and make the following contributions: (a) we observe that the non-giant connected components seem to stabilize in size, (b) we observe the weights on the edges follow several power laws with surprising exponents, and (c) we propose an intuitive, generative model for graph growth that obeys observed patterns.", "year": "2008", "venue": "Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390a40520f70186a0e6f611", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75003", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e7504d", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75330", "5390a5b020f70186a0e7d69e", "5390a63c20f70186a0e81f55", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82f3a", "5390a8b220f70186a0e9cc61", "5390ac1720f70186a0eb301c", "5390ad0620f70186a0ebab7c", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebdf2d", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec5414", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecab39", "5390afc920f70186a0ed2c9e", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef5659", "5390b48420f70186a0efc52f", "5390b56a20f70186a0f04a04", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0a5ba", "5390b86b20f70186a0f293eb", "5390b8d620f70186a0f2ab4f", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2c039", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d245", "5390bfa220f70186a0f542d0", "558ce2340cf2cffe760cdcdf", "55922c640cf2e74f816e365e"], "references": ["5390980720f70186a0e0408c", "539098b820f70186a0e0a843", "5390995d20f70186a0e15cac", "539099b320f70186a0e195e5", "539099b320f70186a0e19a4a", "53909ed120f70186a0e30f21", "53909f2d20f70186a0e394f1", "53909f2d20f70186a0e394f8", "539087f820f70186a0d71f36", "539089bb20f70186a0d9967e", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc3da", "5390b2d720f70186a0eebf7c"], "authors": ["Mary McGlohon", "Leman Akoglu", "Christos Faloutsos"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a8a6c60b4bee2df25836"}}, {"index": "5390a17720f70186a0e52445", "title": "Cut-and-stitch: efficient parallel learning of linear dynamical systems on smps", "abstract": "Multi-core processors with ever increasing number of cores per chip are becoming prevalent in modern parallel computing.

These 3-D faces naturally form a set of second-order tensors-one modality for identity and the other for expression. The number of these second-order tensors is three times of that of the vertices for 3-D face modeling. As for algorithms, Bayesian data modeling, which is a natural data analysis tool, has been widely applied with great success; however, it works only for vector data. Therefore, there is a gap between tensor-based representation and vector-based data analysis tools. Aiming at bridging this gap and generalizing conventional statistical tools over tensors, this paper proposes a decoupled probabilistic algorithm, which is named Bayesian tensor analysis (BTA). Theoretically, BTA can automatically and suitably determine dimensionality for different modalities of tensor data. With BTA, a collection of 3-D faces can be well modeled.

The main novelty of the proposed approach is that it needs no user-defined parameters, relying instead on the principle of Minimum Description Length (MDL), to extract the communities, and to find good cut-points in time when communities change abruptly: a cut-point is good, if it leads to shorter data description.

Several important applications can be modeled as large sparse graphs, e.g., network traffic monitoring, research citation network analysis, social network analysis, and financial transactions. Low-rank decompositions, such as singular value decomposition (SVD) and CUR, are powerful techniques for revealing latent-hidden variables and associated patterns from high dimensional data. However, those methods often ignore the sparsity property of the graph, and hence usually incur too high memory and computational cost to be practical. We propose a novel method, the Compact Matrix Decomposition (CMD), to compute sparse low-rank approximations. CMD dramatically reduces both the computation cost and the space requirements over existing decomposition methods singular value decomposition (SVD) and CUR. Using CMD as the key building block, we further propose procedures to efficiently construct and analyze dynamic graphs from real-time application data. We provide theoretical guarantee for our methods, and present results on two real, large datasets, one on network flow data (100 GB trace of 22K hosts over one month) and one on DBLP (200 MB over 25 years). We show that CMD is often an order of magnitude more efficient than the state of the art (SVD and CUR): it is over 10X faster, but requires less than 1-10 of the space, for the same reconstruction accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate how CMD is used for detecting anomalies and monitoring time-evolving graphs, in which it successfully detects worm-like hierarchical scanning patterns in real network data.

We show that our proposed DynaMMo method (a) can successfully learn the latent variables and their evolution; (b) can provide high compression for little loss of reconstruction accuracy; (c) can extract compact but powerful features for segmentation, interpretation, and forecasting; (d) has complexity linear on the duration of sequences.", "year": "2009", "venue": "Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390adfc20f70186a0ec5261", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec53b1", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda9cb", "5390b44620f70186a0ef8c4b", "5390b4c420f70186a0efed8e", "5390b60d20f70186a0f127f0", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e253", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e2df", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40a3b", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f41382", "558b00bb612c41e6b9d400a9", "558b05a8612c41e6b9d4098c", "558b26ec612c41e6b9d44f8f"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfac88", "5390972920f70186a0dfacba", "5390979920f70186a0dff28e", "5390985d20f70186a0e085a1", "539099a220f70186a0e17eae", "539099ec20f70186a0e1ce9f", "53909a9320f70186a0e22bfb", "53909f2d20f70186a0e37e9d", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe52", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401cf", "5390a17720f70186a0e52456", "5390a28020f70186a0e62aef", "5390a45620f70186a0e72a51", "53908a4020f70186a0d9efed", "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9e86", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a56", "53908e0020f70186a0dd49b9"], "authors": ["Lei Li", "James McCann", "Nancy S.

Through experiments on synthetic graphs, EigenSpokes are shown to be associated with the presence of community structure in these social networks.

It can be particularly useful in anomaly and fraud detection. Many resources are invested in the task of fraud detection due to the high cost of fraud, and being able to automatically detect potential fraud quickly and precisely allows human investigators to work more efficiently. Many data analytic schemes have been put into use; however, schemes that bolster link analysis prove promising. This work builds upon the belief propagation algorithm for use in detecting collusion and other fraud schemes. We propose an algorithm called SNARE (Social Network Analysis for Risk Evaluation). By allowing one to use domain knowledge as well as link knowledge, the method was very successful for pinpointing misstated accounts in our sample of general ledger data, with a significant improvement over the default heuristic in true positive rates, and a lift factor of up to 6.5 (more than twice that of the default heuristic). We also apply SNARE to the task of graph labeling in general on publicly-available datasets. We show that with only some information about the nodes themselves in a network, we get surprisingly high accuracy of labels. Not only is SNARE applicable in a wide variety of domains, but it is also robust to the choice of parameters and highly scalable-linearly with the number of edges in a graph.", "year": "2009", "venue": "Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390aca820f70186a0eb7b06", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec5f07", "5390afc920f70186a0ed21e2", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda976", "5390b13020f70186a0edd8cf", "5390b71120f70186a0f1dbc3", "5390b72d20f70186a0f2054d", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a72e", "5390b9d520f70186a0f31ef1", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f3fae3", "5390bd1520f70186a0f440bd", "558af728612c41e6b9d3ede7", "558b884e612c6b62e5e8ad76", "55323bd245cec66b6f9daa77"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe44", "539098b820f70186a0e0a85f", "5390990f20f70186a0e0f904", "5390990f20f70186a0e106b2", "53909a9320f70186a0e22bdb", "53909ed120f70186a0e30f21", "53909f2d20f70186a0e39505", "53909f2d20f70186a0e39547", "539087fe20f70186a0d73a8b", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fc5", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbd0ce", "5390962020f70186a0df56a0", "539096cb20f70186a0df7a06"], "authors": ["Mary McGlohon", "Stephen Bay", "Markus G.

How would we define, as well as automate, this seemingly selfcontradicting request? We introduce TANGENT, a novel recommendation algorithm to solve this problem. The main idea behind TANGENT is to envision the problem as node selection on a graph, giving high scores to nodes that are well connected to the older choices, and at the same time well connected to unrelated choices. The method is carefully designed to be (a) parameter-free (b) effective and (c) fast. We illustrate the benefits of TANGENT with experiments on both synthetic and real data sets.

As the size of graphs reaches several Giga-, Tera- or Peta-bytes, the necessity for such a library grows too. To the best of our knowledge, PEGASUS is the first such library, implemented on the top of the Hadoop platform, the open source version of MapReduce. Many graph mining operations (PageRank, spectral clustering, diameter estimation, connected components etc.) are essentially a repeated matrix-vector multiplication. In this paper we describe a very important primitive for PEGASUS, called GIM-V (Generalized Iterated Matrix-Vector multiplication).

Using the models, we design a pairwise measure based on manifold learning to measure the dissimilarities between different groups of alerts. A large dissimilarity implies different behaviors between the two groups of alerts. Such measure can therefore be combined with regular classification methods for intrusion detection. We evaluate our framework mainly on Acer 2007, a private dataset gathered from a well-known Security Operation Center in Taiwan. The performance on the real data suggests that the proposed method can achieve high detection accuracy.

Existing graph analysis techniques are not appropriate for such data, especially in cases where streaming or near-real-time results are required. An example that has drawn significant research interest is the cyber-security domain, where internet communication traces are collected and real-time discovery of events, behaviors, patterns, and anomalies is desired. We propose MetricForensics, a scalable framework for analysis of volatile graphs. MetricForensics combines a multi-level \"drill down\" approach, a collection of user-selected graph metrics, and a collection of analysis techniques. At each successive level, more sophisticated metrics are computed and the graph is viewed at finer temporal resolutions. In this way, MetricForensics scales to highly volatile graphs by only allocating resources for computationally expensive analysis when an interesting event is discovered at a coarser resolution first. We test MetricForensics on three real-world graphs: an enterprise IP trace, a trace of legitimate and malicious network traffic from a research institution, and the MIT Reality Mining proximity sensor data. Our largest graph has 3M vertices and 32M edges, spanning 4.5 days. The results demonstrate the scalability and capability of MetricForensics in analyzing volatile graphs; and highlight four novel phenomena in such graphs: elbows, broken correlations, prolonged spikes, and lightweight stars.", "year": "2010", "venue": "Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390b0ca20f70186a0eda96d", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e2e8", "5390ba3820f70186a0f3690d", "55323bbf45cec66b6f9da800"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe09", "5390972920f70186a0dfbe2e", "5390980720f70186a0e040fb", "539098b820f70186a0e0a2c2", "539098b820f70186a0e0ad9b", "539099b320f70186a0e19a0b", "539099b320f70186a0e19a2c", "539099ec20f70186a0e1ccce", "53909f2d20f70186a0e394f7", "53909f2d20f70186a0e394e9", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401bc", "5390a01420f70186a0e48477", "5390a45520f70186a0e718d2", "5390a45620f70186a0e72a51", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e7505f", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e7506c", "539087e720f70186a0d69669", "539087f820f70186a0d71f36", "5390880220f70186a0d78472", "539089bb20f70186a0d9981f", "53908a9620f70186a0da4cfa", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc3db", "53908d6620f70186a0dd2f89", "5390958a20f70186a0df0602", "539095ba20f70186a0df099a", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef5659", "5390880220f70186a0d75ee5"], "authors": ["Keith Henderson", "Tina Eliassi-Rad", "Christos Faloutsos", "Leman Akoglu", "Lei Li", "Koji Maruhashi", "B.

Using the models, we design a pairwise measure based on manifold learning to measure the dissimilarities between different groups of alerts. A large dissimilarity implies different behaviors between the two groups of alerts. Such measure can therefore be combined with regular classification methods for intrusion detection. We evaluate our framework mainly on Acer 2007, a private dataset gathered from a well-known Security Operation Center in Taiwan. The performance on the real data suggests that the proposed method can achieve high detection accuracy.

Existing graph analysis techniques are not appropriate for such data, especially in cases where streaming or near-real-time results are required. An example that has drawn significant research interest is the cyber-security domain, where internet communication traces are collected and real-time discovery of events, behaviors, patterns, and anomalies is desired. We propose MetricForensics, a scalable framework for analysis of volatile graphs. MetricForensics combines a multi-level \"drill down\" approach, a collection of user-selected graph metrics, and a collection of analysis techniques. At each successive level, more sophisticated metrics are computed and the graph is viewed at finer temporal resolutions. In this way, MetricForensics scales to highly volatile graphs by only allocating resources for computationally expensive analysis when an interesting event is discovered at a coarser resolution first. We test MetricForensics on three real-world graphs: an enterprise IP trace, a trace of legitimate and malicious network traffic from a research institution, and the MIT Reality Mining proximity sensor data. Our largest graph has 3M vertices and 32M edges, spanning 4.5 days. The results demonstrate the scalability and capability of MetricForensics in analyzing volatile graphs; and highlight four novel phenomena in such graphs: elbows, broken correlations, prolonged spikes, and lightweight stars.", "year": "2010", "venue": "Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390b0ca20f70186a0eda96d", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e2e8", "5390ba3820f70186a0f3690d", "55323bbf45cec66b6f9da800"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe09", "5390972920f70186a0dfbe2e", "5390980720f70186a0e040fb", "539098b820f70186a0e0a2c2", "539098b820f70186a0e0ad9b", "539099b320f70186a0e19a0b", "539099b320f70186a0e19a2c", "539099ec20f70186a0e1ccce", "53909f2d20f70186a0e394f7", "53909f2d20f70186a0e394e9", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401bc", "5390a01420f70186a0e48477", "5390a45520f70186a0e718d2", "5390a45620f70186a0e72a51", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e7505f", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e7506c", "539087e720f70186a0d69669", "539087f820f70186a0d71f36", "5390880220f70186a0d78472", "539089bb20f70186a0d9981f", "53908a9620f70186a0da4cfa", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc3db", "53908d6620f70186a0dd2f89", "5390958a20f70186a0df0602", "539095ba20f70186a0df099a", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef5659", "5390880220f70186a0d75ee5"], "authors": ["Keith Henderson", "Tina Eliassi-Rad", "Christos Faloutsos", "Leman Akoglu", "Lei Li", "Koji Maruhashi", "B.

We analyzed a large, real network of 3.1 million users and more than one billion phone call records from a private mobile phone company of a large city, spanning 0.1TB. Our first contribution is the TLAC distribution to fit the CDD of each user; TLAC is the truncated version of so-called log-logistic distribution, a skewed, power-law-like distribution. We show that the TLAC is an excellent fit for the overwhelming majority of our users (more than 96% of them), much better than exponential or lognormal.

For such datasets, the traditional matrix model is no longer appropriate and may fail to capture relationships between features or fail to discover the underlying concepts that features represent. These datasets are better modeled using tensors, which are high-order generalizations of matrices. However, naive tensor algorithms suffer from poor efficiency and may fail to consider spatiotemporal neighborhood relationships in analysis. To surmount these difficulties, we propose TWave, a wavelet and tensor-based methodology for automatic summarization, classification, concept discovery, clustering, and compression of complex datasets. We also derive TWaveCluster, a novel high-order clustering approach based on WaveCluster, and compare our approach against WaveCluster and k-means. The efficiency of our method is competitive with WaveCluster and significantly outperforms k-means.

In addition, how can we do so with a mathematically tractable model that allows for rigorous analysis of network properties? Real networks exhibit a long list of surprising properties: Heavy tails for the in- and out-degree distribution, heavy tails for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, small diameters, and densification and shrinking diameters over time. Current network models and generators either fail to match several of the above properties, are complicated to analyze mathematically, or both. Here we propose a generative model for networks that is both mathematically tractable and can generate networks that have all the above mentioned structural properties. Our main idea here is to use a non-standard matrix operation, the Kronecker product, to generate graphs which we refer to as \"Kronecker graphs\". First, we show that Kronecker graphs naturally obey common network properties. In fact, we rigorously prove that they do so. We also provide empirical evidence showing that Kronecker graphs can effectively model the structure of real networks. We then present KRONFIT, a fast and scalable algorithm for fitting the Kronecker graph generation model to large real networks. A naive approach to fitting would take super-exponential time. In contrast, KRONFIT takes linear time, by exploiting the structure of Kronecker matrix multiplication and by using statistical simulation techniques. Experiments on a wide range of large real and synthetic networks show that KRONFIT finds accurate parameters that very well mimic the properties of target networks. In fact, using just four parameters we can accurately model several aspects of global network structure.

Our goal in this article is to monitor multiple numerical streams and determine which pairs are correlated with lags, as well as the value of each such lag. Lag correlations and anticorrelations are frequent and very interesting in practice. For example, a decrease in interest rates typically precedes an increase in house sales by a few months; higher amounts of fluoride in drinking water may lead to fewer dental cavities some years later. Other lag settings include network analysis, sensor monitoring, financial data analysis, and tracking of moving objects. Such data streams are often correlated or anticorrelated, but with unknown lag. We propose BRAID, a method of detecting lag correlations among data streams. BRAID can handle data streams of semi-infinite length incrementally, quickly, and with small resource consumption. However, BRAID requires space and time quadratic on a number of streams k. We also propose ThinBRAID, which is even faster than BRAID, requiring O(k) space and time per time tick. Our theoretical analysis shows that BRAID/ThinBRAID can estimate lag correlations with little or, often, with no error. Our experiments on real and realistic data show that BRAID and ThinBRAID detect the correct lag perfectly most of the time (the largest relative error was about 1&percnt;), while they are significantly faster (up to 40,000 times) than the na\u00efve implementation.", "year": "2010", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD)", "citations": [], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfacba", "5390972920f70186a0dfacb9", "5390981d20f70186a0e06747", "5390985d20f70186a0e06e79", "539098b820f70186a0e0a88a", "539098b820f70186a0e0ad9a", "5390990f20f70186a0e0ff55", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a981", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe3d", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe69", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe52", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401ab", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c7c6", "539087c720f70186a0d56e12", "5390880720f70186a0d78761", "5390880720f70186a0d79fa2", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2b6", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2f2", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2e3", "5390881720f70186a0d804c5", "5390881820f70186a0d8117e", "5390881820f70186a0d816bd", "5390882420f70186a0d890a5", "5390882c20f70186a0d8d165", "5390882d20f70186a0d8daa7", "5390882d20f70186a0d8dac2", "5390882d20f70186a0d8daa6", "539088b920f70186a0d9149b", "53908a5720f70186a0d9fbd9", "53908a7420f70186a0da453f", "53908a9620f70186a0da472b", "53908a9620f70186a0da4742", "53908a9620f70186a0da4877", "53908a9620f70186a0da491a", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc86b", "53908bde20f70186a0dc945c", "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9e86", "53908d6520f70186a0dd19f8", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a2d", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a0a", "53908d6620f70186a0dd2f89", "53908dff20f70186a0dd3efe", "5390958a20f70186a0def8e0", "5390958a20f70186a0df05da", "5390962020f70186a0df4c88", "5390b2fc20f70186a0eef946"], "authors": ["Yasushi Sakurai", "Christos Faloutsos", "Spiros Papadimitriou"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a805c60b4bee2de9f010"}}, {"index": "5390adfd20f70186a0ec53b1", "title": "BoLeRO: a principled technique for including bone length constraints in motion capture occlusion filling", "abstract": "Given a motion capture sequence with occlusions, how can we recover the missing values, respecting bone-length constraints?

Link mining is an important field of data mining. Traditional data mining focuses on \"flat\" data in which each data object is represented as a fixed-length attribute vector. However, many real-world data sets are much richer in structure, involving objects of multiple types that are related to each other. Hence, recently link mining has become an emerging field of data mining, which has a high impact in various important applications such as text mining, social network analysis, collaborative filtering, and bioinformatics. At present, there are no books in the market focusing on the theory and techniques as well as the related applications for link mining. On the other hand, due to the high popularity of linkage data, extensive applications ranging from governmental organizations to commercial businesses to peoples daily life call for exploring the techniques of mining linkage data; people need such a reference book to systematically apply the link mining techniques to these applications to develop the related technologies.

In the thesis, I will focus on the theme of learning and mining large collections of co-evolving sequences, with the goal of developing fast algorithms for finding patterns, summarization, and anomalies. In particular, this thesis will answer the following recurring challenges for time series: 1. Forecasting and imputation: How to do forecasting and to recover missing values in time series data? 2. Pattern discovery and summarization: How to identify the patterns in the time sequences that would facilitate further mining tasks such as compression, segmentation and anomaly detection? 3. Similarity and feature extraction: How to extract compact and meaningful features from multiple co-evolving sequences that will enable better clustering and similarity queries of time series? 4. Scale up: How to handle large data sets on modern computing hardware? We develop models to mine time series with missing values, to extract compact representation from time sequences, to segment the sequences, and to do forecasting. For large scale data, we propose algorithms for learning time series models, in particular, including Linear Dynamical Systems (LDS) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM). We also develop a distributed algorithm for finding patterns in large web-click streams. Our thesis will present special models and algorithms that incorporate domain knowledge. For motion capture, we will describe the natural motion stitching and occlusion filling for human motion. In particular, we provide a metric for evaluating the naturalness of motion stitching, based which we choose the best stitching. Thanks to domain knowledge (body structure and bone lengths), our algorithm is capable of recovering occlusions in mocap sequences, better in accuracy and longer in missing period. We also develop an algorithm for forecasting thermal conditions in a warehouse-sized data center. The forecast will help us control and manage the data center in a energy-efficient way, which can save a significant percentage of electric power consumption in data centers.", "year": "2011", "venue": "Fast algorithms for mining co-evolving time series", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["Christos Faloutsos", "Lei Li"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a6b4c60b4bee2ddaccde"}}, {"index": "5390b04120f70186a0ed870e", "title": "BlogCast effect on information diffusion in a blogosphere", "abstract": "A blog service company provides a function named BlogCast that exposes quality posts on the blog main page to vitalize a blogosphere.

We show that the block-diagonal mental image of the `cavemen graph' is the wrong paradigm, in full agreement with earlier results that real world graphs have no good cuts. Instead, we propose to envision graphs as a collection of hubs connecting spokes, with super-hubs connecting the hubs, and so on, recursively. Based on the idea, we propose the Slash Burn method (burn the hubs, and slash the remaining graph into smaller connected components). Our view point has several advantages: (a) it avoids the `no good cuts' problem, (b) it gives better compression, and (c) it leads to faster execution times for matrix-vector operations, which are the back-bone of most graph processing tools.

We propose ThermoCast, a novel thermal forecasting model to predict the temperatures surrounding the servers in a data center, based on continuous streams of temperature and airflow measurements.

Many recent approaches detect outliers according to reasonable, pre-defined concepts of an outlier (e.g., distance-based, density-based, etc.).

Our OBE (Outlier By Example) system is the first that allows users to provide examples of outliers in low-dimensional datasets. By incorporating a small number of such examples, OBE can successfully develop an algorithm by which to identify further outliers based on their outlierness.

What effect does the average user velocity have on such spread? We answer the initial questions and more.

The dominant color descriptor (DCD) represents a few perceptually dominant colors in an image through color quantization. For image retrieval based on DCD, the earth mover's distance and the optimal color composition distance are proposed to measure the dissimilarity between two images. Although providing good retrieval results, both methods are too time-consuming to be used in a large image database. To solve the problem, we propose a new distance function that calculates an approximate earth mover's distance in linear time. To calculate the dissimilarity in linear time, the proposed approach employs the space-filling curve for multidimensional color space. To improve the accuracy, the proposed approach uses multiple curves and adjusts the color positions. As a result, our approach achieves order-of-magnitude time improvement but incurs small errors. We have performed extensive experiments to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.

How can we find patterns, communities, outliers, in a social network? Which are the most central nodes in a network? These are the questions that motivate this work. Networks and graphs appear in many diverse settings, for example in social networks, computer-communication networks (intrusion detection, traffic management), protein-protein interaction networks in biology, document-text bipartite graphs in text retrieval, person-account graphs in financial fraud detection, and others. In this work, first we list several surprising patterns that real graphs tend to follow. Then we give a detailed list of generators that try to mirror these patterns. Generators are important, because they can help with \"what if\" scenarios, extrapolations, and anonymization. Then we provide a list of powerful tools for graph analysis, and specifically spectral methods (Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)), tensors, and case studies like the famous \"pageRank\" algorithm and the \"HITS\" algorithm for ranking web search results. Finally, we conclude with a survey of tools and observations from related fields like sociology, which provide complementary viewpoints.

In this thesis, we build novel algorithms and tools for mining and modeling large-scale graphs, with a focus on: (1) Graph pattern mining: we discover surprising patterns that hold across diverse real-world graphs, such as the \"fortification effect\" (e.g. the more donors a candidate has, the super-linearly more money s/he will raise), dynamics of connected components over time, and power-laws in human communications, (2) Graph modeling : we build generative mathematical models, such as the RTG model based on \"random typing\" that successfully mimics a long list of properties that real graphs exhibit, (3) Graph anomaly detection: we develop a suite of algorithms to spot abnormalities in various conditions; for (a) plain weighted graphs, (b) binary and categorical attributed graphs, (c) time-evolving graphs, and (d) sensemaking and visualization of anomalies.", "year": "2012", "venue": "Mining and modeling real-world networks: patterns, anomalies, and tools", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["Christos Faloutsos", "Leman Akoglu"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a6c5c60b4bee2ddb804c"}}, {"index": "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a107", "title": "Gelling, and melting, large graphs by edge manipulation", "abstract": "Controlling the dissemination of an entity (e.g., meme, virus, etc) on a large graph is an interesting problem in many disciplines.

An anomalous event, such as a traffic accident, denial of service attack or a chemical spill, can cause a local shift from normal behavior in the network state that persists over an interval of time. Detecting such anomalous regions of network and time extent in large real-world networks is a challenging task. Existing anomaly detection techniques focus on either the time series associated with individual network edges or on global anomalies that affect the entire network. In order to detect anomalous regions, one needs to consider both the time and the affected network substructure jointly, which brings forth computational challenges due to the combinatorial nature of possible solutions. We propose the problem of mining all Significant Anomalous Regions (SAR) in time-evolving networks that asks for the discovery of connected temporal subgraphs comprised of edges that significantly deviate from normal in a persistent manner. We propose an optimal Baseline algorithm for the problem and an efficient approximation, called S IG S POT. Compared to Baseline, SIGSPOT is up to one order of magnitude faster in real data, while achieving less than 10% average relative error rate. In synthetic datasets it is more than 30 times faster than Baseline with 94% accuracy and solves efficiently large instances that are infeasible (more than 10 hours running time) for Baseline.

The landmark-based methods approximate distances by using a few nodes as landmarks, and can accurately estimate shortest-path distances with feasible time complexities. However, they fail at estimating small distances, as it is difficult for a few selected landmarks to cover the shortest paths of many close node pairs. To tackle this problem, we present a novel method EigenSP, that estimates the shortest-path distance by using an adjacency matrix approximated by a few eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

This question captures the essence of the problem we address here. We study the intertwined propagation of two competing \"memes\" (or viruses, rumors, products etc.) in a composite network. A key novelty is the use of a composite network, which in its simplest model is defined as a single set of nodes with two distinct types of edges interconnecting them. Each meme spreads across the composite network in accordance to an SIS-like propagation model (a flu-like infection-recovery). To study the epidemic behavior of our system, we formulate it as a non-linear dynamic system (NLDS). We develop a metric for each meme that is based on the eigenvalue of an appropriately constructed matrix and argue that this metric plays a key role in determining the \"winning\" meme.

Massive datasets are now common in science, government and enterprises. Yet, making sense of these data remains a fundamental challenge. Where do we start our analysis? Where to go next? How to visualize our findings? We answers these questions by bridging Data Mining and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to create tools for making sense of graphs with billions of nodes and edges, focusing on: (1) Attention Routing: we introduce this idea, based on anomaly detection, that automatically draws people's attention to interesting areas of the graph to start their analyses. We present three examples: Polonium unearths malware from 37 billion machine-file relationships; NetProbe fingers bad guys who commit auction fraud. (2) Mixed-Initiative Sensemaking: we present two examples that combine machine inference and visualization to help users locate next areas of interest: Apolo guides users to explore large graphs by learning from few examples of user interest; Graphite finds interesting subgraphs, based on only fuzzy descriptions drawn graphically. (3) Scaling Up: we show how to enable interactive analytics of large graphs by leveraging Hadoop, staging of operations, and approximate computation. This thesis contributes to data mining, HCI, and importantly their intersection, including: interactive systems and algorithms that scale; theories that unify graph mining approaches; and paradigms that overcome fundamental challenges in visual analytics. Our work is making impact to academia and society: Polonium protects 120 million people worldwide from malware; NetProbe made headlines on CNN, WSJ and USA Today; Pegasus won an open-source software award; Apolo helps DARPA detect insider threats and prevent exfiltration.

In this paper we answer this question affirmatively, and give an efficient method called NETSLEUTH for the well-known Susceptible-Infected virus propagation model. Essentially, we are after that set of seed nodes that best explain the given snapshot. We propose to employ the Minimum Description Length principle to identify the best set of seed nodes and virus propagation ripple, as the one by which we can most succinctly describe the infected graph. We give an highly efficient algorithm to identify likely sets of seed nodes given a snapshot. Then, given these seed nodes, we show we can optimize the virus propagation ripple in a principled way by maximizing likelihood. With all three combined, NETSLEUTH can automatically identify the correct number of seed nodes, as well as which nodes are the culprits. Experimentation on our method shows high accuracy in the detection of seed nodes, in addition to the correct automatic identification of their number.

Even with the aid of an uncountable number of descriptive statistics and background information, only a few can correctly guess the outcome of a game or a league. In this work, our approach is to move away from the traditional way of predicting sports events, and instead to model sports leagues as networks of players and teams where the only information available is the work relationships among them. We propose two network-based models to predict the behavior of teams in sports leagues. These models are parameter-free, that is, they do not have a single parameter, and moreover are sport-agnostic: they can be applied directly to any team sports league. First, we view a sports league as a network in evolution, and we infer the implicit feedback behind network changes and properties over the years. Then, we use this knowledge to construct the network-based prediction models, which can, with a significantly high probability, indicate how well a team will perform over a season. We compare our proposed models with other prediction models in two of the most popular sports leagues: the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Major League Baseball (MLB).

Suppose that they are strong/virulent enough, so that each, if left alone, could lead to an epidemic. What will happen when both operate on the network? Earlier models assume that there is perfect competition: if a user buys product 'A' (or gets infected with virus 'X'), she will never buy product 'B' (or virus 'Y'). This is not always true: for example, a user could install and use both Firefox and Google Chrome as browsers. Similarly, one type of flu may give partial immunity against some other similar disease. In the case of full competition, it is known that 'winner takes all,' that is the weaker virus/product will become extinct. In the case of no competition, both viruses survive, ignoring each other.

Examples include the predicates (subject, verb, object) in knowledge bases, hyperlinks and anchor texts in the Web graphs, sensor streams (time, location, and type), social networks over time, and DBLP conference-author-keyword relations. Tensor decomposition is an important data mining tool with various applications including clustering, trend detection, and anomaly detection. However, current tensor decomposition algorithms are not scalable for large tensors with billions of sizes and hundreds millions of nonzeros: the largest tensor in the literature remains thousands of sizes and hundreds thousands of nonzeros. Consider a knowledge base tensor consisting of about 26 million noun-phrases. The intermediate data explosion problem, associated with naive implementations of tensor decomposition algorithms, would require the materialization and the storage of a matrix whose largest dimension would be \u22487 x 1014; this amounts to ~10 Petabytes, or equivalently a few data centers worth of storage, thereby rendering the tensor analysis of this knowledge base, in the naive way, practically impossible. In this paper, we propose GIGATENSOR, a scalable distributed algorithm for large scale tensor decomposition. GIGATENSOR exploits the sparseness of the real world tensors, and avoids the intermediate data explosion problem by carefully redesigning the tensor decomposition algorithm. Extensive experiments show that our proposed GIGATENSOR solves 100 times bigger problems than existing methods. Furthermore, we employ GIGATENSOR in order to analyze a very large real world, knowledge base tensor and present our astounding findings which include discovery of potential synonyms among millions of noun-phrases (e.g. the noun 'pollutant' and the noun-phrase 'greenhouse gases').", "year": "2012", "venue": "Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390ba3820f70186a0f36e24", "5390bae520f70186a0f3bbbe", "558b092c612c41e6b9d40f0d", "558bd5280cf23f2dfc593f3c", "558b493c612c41e6b9d4836c", "55323b7445cec66b6f9d9f0b"], "references": ["5390981d20f70186a0e05a0c", "53909a9320f70186a0e22c1b", "53909ee020f70186a0e32ba9", "53909f2d20f70186a0e394f6", "53909f6a20f70186a0e3b4e0", "53909fbc20f70186a0e41954", "53909fca20f70186a0e45dee", "5390a01420f70186a0e4702a", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c721", "5390a30b20f70186a0e6a52e", "5390a74e20f70186a0e8b46a", "5390a77d20f70186a0e8fd90", "5390a9a420f70186a0ea493c", "5390b04120f70186a0ed7803", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda9ac", "5390b0ca20f70186a0edb10a", "5390b1d220f70186a0ee235d", "5390b4da20f70186a0f01686", "5390b64020f70186a0f1a7c0", "539087fe20f70186a0d73a8b", "539096cb20f70186a0df8915"], "authors": ["U.

Existing methods are typically superlinear in space or execution time. Halite's strengths are that it is fast and scalable, while still giving highly accurate results. Specifically the main contributions of Halite are: 1) Scalability: it is linear or quasi linear in time and space regarding the data size and dimensionality, and the dimensionality of the clusters' subspaces; 2) Usability: it is deterministic, robust to noise, doesn't take the number of clusters as an input parameter, and detects clusters in subspaces generated by original axes or by their linear combinations, including space rotation; 3) Effectiveness: it is accurate, providing results with equal or better quality compared to top related works; and 4) Generality: it includes a soft clustering approach. Experiments on synthetic data ranging from five to 30 axes and up to 1 \\rm million points were performed. Halite was in average at least 12 times faster than seven representative works, and always presented highly accurate results. On real data, Halite was at least 11 times faster than others, increasing their accuracy in up to 35 percent.

Can it be made automatically? Based on the work discussed in this book, the answers to both questions are a sound yes, and the results can be obtained in just minutes. In fact, results that used to require days or weeks of hard work from human specialists can now be obtained in minutes with high precision. Data Mining in Large Sets of Complex Data discusses new algorithms that take steps forward from traditional data mining (especially for clustering) by considering large, complex datasets. Usually, other works focus in one aspect, either data size or complexity. This work considers both: it enables mining complex data from high impact applications, such as breast cancer diagnosis, region classification in satellite images, assistance to climate change forecast, recommendation systems for the Web and social networks; the data are large in the Terabyte-scale, not in Giga as usual; and very accurate results are found in just minutes.

The goal of this tutorial is to provide a general, comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art methods for anomaly, event, and fraud detection in data represented as graphs. As a key contribution, we provide a thorough exploration of both data mining and machine learning algorithms for these detection tasks. We give a general framework for the algorithms, categorized under various settings: unsupervised vs.(semi-)supervised, for static vs. dynamic data. We focus on the scalability and effectiveness aspects of the methods, and highlight results on crucial real-world applications, including accounting fraud and opinion spam detection.", "year": "2013", "venue": "Proceedings of the sixth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining", "citations": [], "references": ["5390990f20f70186a0e0ff78", "53909ed120f70186a0e30f21", "53909f2d20f70186a0e3952d", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401be", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4a906", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75067", "5390b24320f70186a0ee61c8", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef5659", "5390958a20f70186a0df0602"], "authors": ["Leman Akoglu", "Christos Faloutsos"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a833c60b4bee2dec4e88"}}, {"index": "5390bb7b20f70186a0f3fe9f", "title": "Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD Workshop on Interactive Data Exploration and Analytics", "abstract": "We have entered the era of big data. Massive datasets, surpassing terabytes and petabytes in size are now commonplace. They arise in numerous settings in science, government, and enterprises, and technology exists by which we can collect and store such massive amounts of information. Yet, making sense of these data remains a fundamental challenge. We lack the means to exploratively analyze databases of this scale. Currently, few technologies allow us to freely \"wander\" around the data, and make discoveries by following our intuition, or serendipity. While standard data mining aims at finding highly interesting results, it is typically computationally demanding and time consuming, thus may not be well-suited for interactive exploration of large datasets. Interactive data mining techniques that aptly integrate human intuition, by means of visualization and intuitive human-computer interaction techniques, and machine computation support have been shown to help people gain significant insights into a wide range of problems.

Suspicious graph patterns show up in many applications, from Twitter users who buy fake followers, manipulating the social network, to botnet members performing distributed denial of service attacks, disturbing the network traffic graph. We propose a fast and effective method, CatchSync, which exploits two of the tell-tale signs left in graphs by fraudsters: (a) synchronized behavior: suspicious nodes have extremely similar behavior pattern, because they are often required to perform some task together (such as follow the same user); and (b) rare behavior: their connectivity patterns are very different from the majority. We introduce novel measures to quantify both concepts (\\\"synchronicity\\\" and \\\"normality\\\") and we propose a parameter-free algorithm that works on the resulting synchronicity-normality plots. Thanks to careful design, CatchSync has the following desirable properties: (a) it is scalable to large datasets, being linear on the graph size; (b) it is parameter free; and (c) it is side-information-oblivious: it can operate using only the topology, without needing labeled data, nor timing information, etc., while still capable of using side information, if available. We applied CatchSync on two large, real datasets 1-billion-edge Twitter social graph and 3-billion-edge Tencent Weibo social graph, and several synthetic ones; CatchSync consistently outperforms existing competitors, both in detection accuracy by 36% on Twitter and 20% on Tencent Weibo, as well as in speed.", "year": "2014", "venue": "Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": [], "references": ["5390af8920f70186a0ed092b", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2e6", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef5659", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d347", "5390880220f70186a0d78472", "5390b5c620f70186a0f07fa7", "5390980720f70186a0e040fb", "5390a45520f70186a0e718d2", "5390b29820f70186a0ee97c4", "5390b63320f70186a0f17cbc", "5390980720f70186a0e03a54", "53909fca20f70186a0e43e48", "539087f820f70186a0d71f36", "539099b320f70186a0e1b890", "5390bded20f70186a0f48d7e", "5390bf1320f70186a0f50999", "539087fe20f70186a0d73a8b", "5390a96f20f70186a0ea486f", "5390958a20f70186a0df0602", "53909ed120f70186a0e30f21", "539098b820f70186a0e0a848", "5390b1d220f70186a0ee2373", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef565b", "5390881720f70186a0d804eb", "5390990f20f70186a0e0ff78", "53908a9620f70186a0da4c09", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d11c", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec7fe9", "5390958a20f70186a0df05d5", "5390ac5720f70186a0eb5cc3"], "authors": ["Meng Jiang", "Peng Cui", "Alex Beutel", "Christos Faloutsos", "Shiqiang Yang"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a78ec60b4bee2de4b083"}}, {"index": "558b8b4a612c6b62e5e8b2c4", "title": "FUNNEL: automatic mining of spatially coevolving epidemics", "abstract": "Given a large collection of epidemiological data consisting of the count of d contagious diseases for l locations of duration n, how can we find patterns, rules and outliers?

We also report a case study of our method's practical usage to show that QuMinS is a viable tool for automatic coffee crop detection from remote sensing images.", "year": "2014", "venue": "Information Sciences: an International Journal", "citations": [], "references": ["5390979920f70186a0e0001e", "5390985d20f70186a0e06e6e", "5390990f20f70186a0e0ff4a", "539099b320f70186a0e19a57", "53909a0220f70186a0e1f0be", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2ea32", "5390a01420f70186a0e48477", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4b1a7", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4fd48", "5390a17720f70186a0e52a15", "5390a1e620f70186a0e5b474", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d576", "5390a6d920f70186a0e885b5", "5390a72220f70186a0e8ac43", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb11ac", "5390ac5720f70186a0eb600e", "5390aca820f70186a0eb8995", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec444d", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec801f", "5390af8920f70186a0ecfd4b", "5390b13020f70186a0edd340", "5390b19020f70186a0edfd98", "5390b29820f70186a0ee8e35", "5390b29820f70186a0eea757", "5390b4c420f70186a0efeda1", "5390b4da20f70186a0eff807", "5390b4da20f70186a0eff7d5", "5390b68720f70186a0f1cae9", "5390b78a20f70186a0f236f5", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a5b2", "5390bae520f70186a0f3b345", "5390882720f70186a0d8a133", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fd3", "53908a9620f70186a0da4c2c", "53908a9620f70186a0da4e41", "53908bfb20f70186a0dcac95"], "authors": ["Robson L.

Our model provides new insights into what Nobel Laure- ate Herbert A. Simon called the \\\"marketplace of attention,\\\" which we recast as the attention-activity marketplace. Our model design is further substantiated by user-level activity of 250,000 MySpace users obtained between 2004 and 2009.

Today, millions of people carrying smartphones or tablets are able to communicate practically any time and anywhere they want. They can access their e-mails, comment on weblogs, watch and post videos and photos (as well as comment on them), and make phone calls or text messages almost ubiquitously. Given this scenario, in this article, we tackle a fundamental aspect of this new era of communication: How the time intervals between communication events behave for different technologies and means of communications. Are there universal patterns for the Inter-Event Time Distribution (IED)&quest; How do inter-event times behave differently among particular technologies&quest; To answer these questions, we analyzed eight different datasets from real and modern communication data and found four well-defined patterns seen in all the eight datasets. Moreover, we propose the use of the Self-Feeding Process (SFP) to generate inter-event times between communications. The SFP is an extremely parsimonious point process that requires at most two parameters and is able to generate inter-event times with all the universal properties we observed in the data. We also show three potential applications of the SFP: as a framework to generate a synthetic dataset containing realistic communication events of any one of the analyzed means of communications, as a technique to detect anomalies, and as a building block for more specific models that aim to encompass the particularities seen in each of the analyzed systems.", "year": "2015", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD) - TKDD Special Issue (SIGKDD'13)", "citations": [], "references": ["5390b71120f70186a0f1ec9f", "5390882c20f70186a0d8d165", "5390b4c420f70186a0efe9eb", "5390a74e20f70186a0e8b63f", "5390a6d920f70186a0e86b27", "539087f820f70186a0d71f36", "53908a5720f70186a0d9fe47", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc3db", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75025", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe3f6", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d3ae"], "authors": ["Pedro O.

We conjecture that online activities compete for user attention in the same way that species in an ecosystem compete for food.

Our second contribution is a novel, parameter-free, and scalable fitting algorithm, ECOWEB-FIT, that estimates the parameters of ECOWEB.

The objective of this tutorial is to provide a concise and intuitive overview of the most important tools that can help us find patterns in large-scale time-series sequences. We review the state of the art in four related fields: (1) similarity search and pattern discovery, (2) linear modeling and summarization, (3) non-linear modeling and forecasting, and (4) the extension of time-series mining and tensor analysis.

And how can we tell which accounts belong to liberal, conservative or centrist users? Often, we can answer such questions and label nodes in a network based on the labels of their neighbors and appropriate assumptions of homophily (\\\"birds of a feather flock together\\\") or heterophily (\\\"opposites attract\\\"). One of the most widely used methods for this kind of inference is Belief Propagation (BP) which iteratively propagates the information from a few nodes with explicit labels throughout a network until convergence. A well-known problem with BP, however, is that there are no known exact guarantees of convergence in graphs with loops. This paper introduces Linearized Belief Propagation (LinBP), a linearization of BP that allows a closed-form solution via intuitive matrix equations and, thus, comes with exact convergence guarantees. It handles homophily, heterophily, and more general cases that arise in multi-class settings. Plus, it allows a compact implementation in SQL. The paper also introduces Single-pass Belief Propagation (SBP), a localized (or \\\"myopic\\\") version of LinBP that propagates information across every edge at most once and for which the final class assignments depend only on the nearest labeled neighbors. In addition, SBP allows fast incremental updates in dynamic networks. Our runtime experiments show that LinBP and SBP are orders of magnitude faster than standard BP, while leading to almost identical node labels.", "year": "2015", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "citations": ["55323bd245cec66b6f9daa7a"], "references": ["558fc022612c29c89cd7ae24", "539087f320f70186a0d6f794", "5390a77d20f70186a0e8fdde", "539087ef20f70186a0d6e1ac", "53908a5820f70186a0da0cc1", "539099a220f70186a0e172f4", "5390985d20f70186a0e06e53", "5390a79f20f70186a0e922f1", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab83a", "53909ee020f70186a0e31eb4", "53908cde20f70186a0dcdbe8", "539098b820f70186a0e0be75", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebdf38", "5390b04120f70186a0ed7803", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a10", "5390a79f20f70186a0e92301", "5390b13020f70186a0edd8cf", "5390b5f920f70186a0f0e990", "5390b2d720f70186a0eebf7c", "53909ee020f70186a0e32252", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75067", "5390a01420f70186a0e4694d", "5390b5fa20f70186a0f10321", "5390b7fe20f70186a0f26dd0", "5390979920f70186a0e0001e", "53909ed120f70186a0e30f21", "5390878a20f70186a0d379c9", "53908bcc20f70186a0dc5f71", "5390b24320f70186a0ee7005", "539099a220f70186a0e18000", "53909a9320f70186a0e22c4a", "5390994d20f70186a0e1369c", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbd0ce"], "authors": ["Wolfgang Gatterbauer", "Stephan G\u00fcnnemann", "Danai Koutra", "Christos Faloutsos"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a8e8c60b4bee2df5beba"}}]
