Our analysis is based on the Taylor series expansion of the convolution sum. Our analysis shows the need and derives the method for the normalization of derivative filter weights. Under certain minimal restrictions of the underlying function, we are able to compute tight absolute error bounds of the reconstruction process. We demonstrate the utilization of our methods to the analysis of the class of cubic BC-spline filters. As our technique is not restricted to interpolation filters, we are able to show that the Catmull-Rom spline filter and its derivative are the most accurate reconstruction and derivative filters, respectively, among the class of BC-spline filters. We also present a new derivative filter which features better spatial accuracy than any derivative BC-spline filter, and is optimal within our framework. We conclude by demonstrating the use of these optimal filters for accurate interpolation and gradient estimation in volume rendering.", "year": "1997", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics", "citations": ["5390975920f70186a0dfc72b", "5390979920f70186a0e00525", "5390980720f70186a0e02058", "5390a2be20f70186a0e65015", "5390a6b120f70186a0e85ed8", "5390b24420f70186a0ee7413", "5390b24420f70186a0ee7756", "5390b7ff20f70186a0f276c1", "5390b86b20f70186a0f28148", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2814c", "5390b95520f70186a0f2f749", "5590ce4a0cf237666fc28d40", "539087e620f70186a0d6752c", "539087eb20f70186a0d6c073", "539087eb20f70186a0d6c04e", "539087eb20f70186a0d6c078", "539087eb20f70186a0d6c0e9", "539087f820f70186a0d72a33", "5390880720f70186a0d79c24", "5390880720f70186a0d79c21", "5390893e20f70186a0d92ed7", "539089ab20f70186a0d96b42", "539089bb20f70186a0d98878", "539089bb20f70186a0d98893", "539089bb20f70186a0d988b1", "53908ae020f70186a0dadc32"], "references": ["539087a520f70186a0d49123", "539087c720f70186a0d56c26", "539087d920f70186a0d6092d", "5390881220f70186a0d7ec9d", "5390881220f70186a0d7ecbb", "5390878720f70186a0d36057", "539089bb20f70186a0d9882d", "539089bb20f70186a0d98824", "5390879520f70186a0d3e9ad", "5390958a20f70186a0defa93"], "authors": ["Torsten M\u00f6ller", "Raghu Machiraju", "Klaus Mueller", "Roni Yagel"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a691c60b4bee2dd90111"}}, {"index": "539087e620f70186a0d67561", "title": "An anti-aliasing technique for splatting", "abstract": "", "year": "1997", "venue": "VIS '97 Proceedings of the 8th conference on Visualization '97", "citations": ["5390975920f70186a0dfcbda", "5390979920f70186a0e0052d", "539098b820f70186a0e0a6ef", "53909e7c20f70186a0e2bbd6", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2813e", "5390b86b20f70186a0f28155", "5390b86b20f70186a0f28126", "539087eb20f70186a0d6a620", "539087eb20f70186a0d6c05b", "539087eb20f70186a0d6c059", "539087eb20f70186a0d6c0c0", "5390880220f70186a0d77fd9", "5390881720f70186a0d7fc22", "5390881820f70186a0d8164e", "5390893e20f70186a0d92eda", "539089ab20f70186a0d96a88", "539089ab20f70186a0d96ab6", "539089bb20f70186a0d98858", "539089bb20f70186a0d988cb", "53908bcc20f70186a0dc5719", "539095bb20f70186a0df285e"], "references": ["539087a120f70186a0d4748f", "539087ae20f70186a0d4da93", "539087c720f70186a0d56f63", "539087c720f70186a0d5842e", "539087d920f70186a0d6092a", "539087d920f70186a0d6092d", "539087dd20f70186a0d62837", "5390878320f70186a0d325d2", "5390878720f70186a0d36057", "5390879220f70186a0d3d25d", "5390879920f70186a0d41b8b", "5390879920f70186a0d4203f", "539087fe20f70186a0d74a0a", "5390881220f70186a0d7ec9d", "5390882120f70186a0d857bb", "539089bb20f70186a0d987f9", "539089bb20f70186a0d9881d", "539089bb20f70186a0d98824", "53908bcc20f70186a0dc6cc4", "5390940220f70186a0de84da", "5390958a20f70186a0def783", "5390958a20f70186a0def76a", "5390958a20f70186a0defa93"], "authors": ["J.

First, an antialiasing extension to the basic splatting algorithm is introduced that mitigates the spatial aliasing for high-resolution volumes. Aliasing can be severe for high-resolution volumes or volumes where a high depth of field leads to converging samples along the perspective axis. Next, an analysis of the common approximation errors in the splatting process for perspective viewing is presented. In this context, we give different implementations, distinguished by efficiency and accuracy, for adding the splat contributions to the image plane. We then present new results in controlling the splatting errors and also show their behavior in the framework of our new antialiasing technique. Finally, current work in progress on extensions to splatting for temporal antialiasing is demonstrated. Here, we present a simple but highly effective scheme for adding motion blur to fast moving volumes.", "year": "1998", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics", "citations": ["5390979920f70186a0e0052d", "5390980720f70186a0e0205f", "53909a9320f70186a0e21a99", "5390a7f520f70186a0e942e6", "5390b7fe20f70186a0f26588", "5390b7ff20f70186a0f278dc", "5390b86b20f70186a0f280d9", "5390b86b20f70186a0f28155", "5390b86b20f70186a0f28126", "539087eb20f70186a0d6c05b", "539087eb20f70186a0d6c0c0", "5390881220f70186a0d7e176", "5390881220f70186a0d7e17e", "5390881720f70186a0d7fc22", "5390893e20f70186a0d9272f", "539089ab20f70186a0d96b33", "539089bb20f70186a0d98870", "539089bb20f70186a0d988cb", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc860", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbd34c", "5390962020f70186a0df49f0"], "references": ["539087a120f70186a0d4748f", "539087ae20f70186a0d4da93", "539087c720f70186a0d56f63", "539087d920f70186a0d60927", "539087dd20f70186a0d62837", "539087e620f70186a0d67561", "539087fe20f70186a0d74a0a", "5390881220f70186a0d7ec9d", "539089bb20f70186a0d987f7", "539089bb20f70186a0d987f9", "539089bb20f70186a0d9881d", "5390879920f70186a0d41b8b", "5390879920f70186a0d4203f", "539089bb20f70186a0d98e9b", "5390958a20f70186a0def783"], "authors": ["Klaus Mueller", "Torsten M\u00f6ller", "J.

In splatting, each projected voxel is represented as a radially symmetric interpolation kernel, equivalent to a fuzzy ball. Projecting such a basis function leaves a fuzzy impression, called a footprint or splat, on the screen. Splatting traditionally classifies and shades the voxels prior to projection, and thus each voxel footprint is weighted by the assigned voxel color and opacity. Projecting these fuzzy color balls provides a uniform screen image for homogeneous object regions, but leads to a blurry appearance of object edges. The latter is clearly undesirable, especially when the view is zoomed on the object. In this work, we manipulate the rendering pipeline of splatting by performing the classification and shading process after the voxels have been projected onto the screen. In this way, volume contributions outside the iso-range never affect the image. Since shading requires gradients, we not only splat the density volume, using regular splats, but we also project the gradient volume, using gradient splats. However, alternative to gradient splats, we can also compute the gradients on the projection plane, using central differencing. This latter scheme cuts the number of footprint rasterization by a factor of four, since only the voxel densities have to be projected.

Grid structures based on a Cartesian lattice are the de-facto standard for regular representations of volumetric data. In this paper we introduce a more general concept of regular grids for the representation of volumetric data. We demonstrate that a specific type of regular lattice --- the so-called body-centered cubic --- is able to represent the same data set as a Cartesian grid to the same accuracy but with 29.3% fewer samples. This speeds up traditional volume rendering algorithms by the same ratio, which we demonstrate by adopting a splatting implementation for these new lattices. We investigate different filtering methods required for computing the normals on this lattice. The lattice representation results also in lossless compression ratios that are better than previously reported. Although other regular grid structures achieve the same sample efficiency, the body-centered cubic is particularly easy to use.

We propose to perform the shear transformation in the frequency domain. Unlike the standard shear-warp algorithm, we allow for arbitrary sampling distances along the viewing rays, independent from the view direction. The accurate scaling of the volume slices is achieved by using the zero padding interpolation property. Finally, a high quality gradient estimation scheme is presented which uses the derivative theorem of the Fourier transform. Experimental results show that the presented method outperforms established algorithms in the quality of the produced images. If the data is sampled above the Nyquist rate the presented method is capable of a perfect reconstruction of the original function.", "year": "2005", "venue": "EUROVIS'05 Proceedings of the Seventh Joint Eurographics / IEEE VGTC conference on Visualization", "citations": ["5390afc920f70186a0ed26c5", "5390b7ff20f70186a0f278d7"], "references": ["5390979920f70186a0e00525", "539087af20f70186a0d4ea40", "539087b320f70186a0d5110d", "539087be20f70186a0d51e83", "539087c720f70186a0d56f63", "5390b64020f70186a0f19869", "5390878320f70186a0d33e1f", "5390878720f70186a0d36057", "5390879220f70186a0d3d25d", "539087d920f70186a0d61a63", "539087eb20f70186a0d6c078", "5390881820f70186a0d8164b", "5390893e20f70186a0d92edb", "539089bb20f70186a0d98824", "53908bad20f70186a0dc315c", "5390958a20f70186a0defa93"], "authors": ["Martin Artner", "Torsten M\u00f6ller", "Ivan Viola", "Meister E.

The principle idea is to consider a time-varying data set as a 3D array where each voxel contains a time-activity curve (TAC). We define and appraise three different TAC similarity measures. Based on these measures we introduce three methods to analyze and visualize time-varying data. The first method relates the whole data set to one template TAC and creates a 1D histogram. The second method extends the 1D histogram into a 2D histogram by taking the Euclidean distance between voxels into account. The third method does not rely on a template TAC but rather creates a 2D scatter-plot of all TAC data points via multi-dimensional scaling. These methods allow the user to specify transfer functions on the 1D and 2D histograms and on the scatter plot, respectively. We validate these methods on synthetic dynamic SPECT and PET data sets and a dynamic planar Gamma camera image of a patient.

Further, we characterize full spectra of lights, surfaces, and transmissive materials in an efficient linear subspace model by forming eigenvectors of sets of spectra and transform them to an intermediate space in which spectral interactions reduce to simple component-wise multiplications during rendering. The proposed method enhances the user's freedom in designing photo-realistic scenes and helps in creating expressive visualizations. A key application of our technique is to use specific spectral lighting to scale the visual complexity of a scene by controlling visibility of texture details in surface graphics or material details in volume rendering.", "year": "2009", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)", "citations": ["5390a54620f70186a0e77fed", "5390aeba20f70186a0ec96f5"], "references": ["5390980720f70186a0e0205d", "53909a0220f70186a0e1f92f", "539087b320f70186a0d51100", "539087b320f70186a0d51103", "539087be20f70186a0d51634", "539087c720f70186a0d56f1a", "539087c720f70186a0d588f9", "539087f320f70186a0d70f94", "539089ab20f70186a0d96b35", "539089bb20f70186a0d98890", "539089bb20f70186a0d98d57", "539089bb20f70186a0d99017", "539089bb20f70186a0d99019", "53908a4020f70186a0d9ddec", "53908e0020f70186a0dd4a22", "5390962020f70186a0df430c", "5390b64020f70186a0f19635"], "authors": ["Steven Bergner", "Mark S.

Vismon was designed to support sophisticated data analysis of simulation results by managers who are highly knowledgeable about the fisheries domain but not experts in simulation software and statistical data analysis. The previous workflow required the scientists who built the models to spearhead the analysis process. The features of Vismon include sensitivity analysis, comprehensive and global trade-offs analysis, and a staged approach to the visualization of the uncertainty of the underlying simulation model. The tool was iteratively refined through a multi-year engagement with fisheries scientists with a two-phase approach, where an initial diverging experimentation phase to test many alternatives was followed by a converging phase where the set of multiple linked views that proved effective were integrated together in a useable way. Several fisheries scientists have used Vismon to communicate with policy makers, and it is scheduled for deployment to policy makers in Alaska. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "year": "2012", "venue": "Computer Graphics Forum", "citations": ["5390bf1320f70186a0f51cd1", "558afcdb612c41e6b9d3fb07"], "references": ["539099ec20f70186a0e1d6a8", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3f778", "5390a01420f70186a0e4833c", "539087aa20f70186a0d4bdf1", "5390ada620f70186a0ec248c", "5390ada620f70186a0ec24b5", "5390b20120f70186a0ee505d", "5390b20120f70186a0ee507b", "5390b20120f70186a0ee506e", "5390878720f70186a0d3451c", "539087d920f70186a0d61192", "539087e120f70186a0d6589c", "5390880220f70186a0d780f1", "53908cde20f70186a0dcd8e1", "5390958a20f70186a0def771", "5390b95520f70186a0f2f742", "5390b95520f70186a0f2f752", "5390b95520f70186a0f2f7b4"], "authors": ["Maryam Booshehrian", "Torsten M\u00f6ller", "Randall M.

Our goal is to reflect on a meta-level about evaluation in our community through a systematic understanding of the characteristics and goals of presented evaluations. For this purpose we conducted a systematic review of ten years of evaluations in the published papers using and extending a coding scheme previously established by Lam et al. [2012]. The results of our review include an overview of the most common evaluation goals in the community, how they evolved over time, and how they contrast or align to those of the IEEE Information Visualization conference. In particular, we found that evaluations specific to assessing resulting images and algorithm performance are the most prevalent (with consistently 80-90% of all papers since 1997). However, especially over the last six years there is a steady increase in evaluation methods that include participants, either by evaluating their performances and subjective feedback or by evaluating their work practices and their improved analysis and reasoning capabilities using visual tools. Up to 2010, this trend in the IEEE Visualization conference was much more pronounced than in the IEEE Information Visualization conference which only showed an increasing percentage of evaluation through user performance and experience testing. Since 2011, however, also papers in IEEE Information Visualization show such an increase of evaluations of work practices and analysis as well as reasoning using visual tools. Further, we found that generally the studies reporting requirements analyses and domain-specific work practices are too informally reported which hinders cross-comparison and lowers external validity.", "year": "2013", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics", "citations": ["558b772e612c6b62e5e8930b", "558bd24e0cf23f2dfc593b80", "558b211f612c41e6b9d443fa", "558b1692612c41e6b9d42bf1", "558b8b9f612c6b62e5e8b34e", "558b4fc6612c41e6b9d48eb3", "558aebee612c41e6b9d3d8c4", "558af853612c41e6b9d3f0a9", "558b24f8612c41e6b9d44bcd", "5592561f0cf2aff368683c44"], "references": [], "authors": ["Tobias Isenberg", "Petra Isenberg", "Jian Chen", "Michael Sedlmair", "Torsten M\u00f6ller"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a8f2c60b4bee2df63cfb"}}]
