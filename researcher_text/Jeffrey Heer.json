[{"index": "5390881720f70186a0d806d9", "title": "Separating the swarm: categorization methods for user sessions on the web", "abstract": "Understanding user behaviors on Web sites enables site owners to make sites more usable, ultimately helping users to achieve their goals more quickly. Accordingly, researchers have devised methods for categorizing user sessions in hopes of revealing user interests. These techniques build user profiles by combining users' navigation paths with other data features, such as page viewing time, hyperlink structure, and page content. Previously, we have presented complex techniques of combining many of these data features to cluster user profiles. In this paper, we introduce a user study and a systematic evaluation of these different data features and their associated weighting schemes. We present the results of our study, including accuracy measures for a number of clustering approaches, and offer recommendations for Web analysts. While further investigation over more sites is needed to definitively settle on a robust scheme, we have characterized this analytic space", "year": "2002", "venue": "Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems", "citations": ["5390975920f70186a0dfc2ca", "5390981d20f70186a0e048c9", "5390990f20f70186a0e10d58", "53909ed120f70186a0e3091a", "53909ed120f70186a0e319ed", "53909f2d20f70186a0e38d78", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401ae", "5390a01420f70186a0e48729", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75318", "5390a5b020f70186a0e7d69f", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea1e44", "5390a9a420f70186a0ea56bd", "5390ac1820f70186a0eb3339", "5390ad8920f70186a0ec09af", "5390b2fc20f70186a0eee877", "5390b63320f70186a0f16f61", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f34a16", "5390bda020f70186a0f469e7", "5390bda020f70186a0f47afc", "5390bda020f70186a0f47d36", "53908a4020f70186a0d9dbc4", "539096cb20f70186a0df7a41", "5390972920f70186a0dfa079"], "references": ["53909ee020f70186a0e32c8e", "539087d420f70186a0d5fd7b", "539087d920f70186a0d60598", "539087e120f70186a0d65784", "539087f320f70186a0d70f48", "5390881720f70186a0d803fc", "539089ab20f70186a0d96040", "539089ab20f70186a0d9603d", "53908b2120f70186a0db60bb", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbe2b6", "53908bcc20f70186a0dc599a", "5390956e20f70186a0debbaf"], "authors": ["Jeffrey Heer", "Ed H.

The logging portion of WebQuilt unobtrusively gathers clickstream data as users complete specified tasks. This data is then aggregated and presented as an interactive graph, where nodes of the graph are images of the web pages visited, and arrows are the transitions between pages. To aid analysis of the gathered usability test data, the WebQuilt visualization provides filtering capabilities and semantic zooming, allowing the designer to understand the test results at the gestalt view of the entire graph, and then drill down to sub-paths and single pages. The visualization highlights important usability issues, such as pages where users spent a lot of time, pages where users get off track during the task, navigation patterns, and exit pages, all within the context of a specific task. WebQuilt is designed to conduct remote usability testing on a variety of Internet-enabled devices and provide a way to identify potential usability problems when the tester cannot be present to observe and record user actions.", "year": "2002", "venue": "Proceedings of the Working Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces", "citations": ["5390981d20f70186a0e04d9f", "5390981d20f70186a0e04dc1", "5390a25820f70186a0e6035b", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea6782", "5390b5ed20f70186a0f0c33e", "558b2dd6612c41e6b9d45cd3", "5390962020f70186a0df41b2", "5390972920f70186a0dfa0e8"], "references": ["539087d420f70186a0d5fda4", "539087eb20f70186a0d6af48", "539087ef20f70186a0d6e46c", "539087f320f70186a0d6f432", "539087fe20f70186a0d754cf", "5390880720f70186a0d79d7a", "5390881220f70186a0d7f79f", "5390881720f70186a0d803fc", "5390881720f70186a0d8056a", "5390881820f70186a0d80f87", "53908cde20f70186a0dcd8bf"], "authors": ["Sarah J.

Cleveland proposes an optimization technique for computing the aspect ratio such that the average absolute orientation of line segments in the chart is equal to 45 degrees. This technique, called banking to 45 degrees, is designed to maximize the discriminability of the orientations of the line segments in the chart. In this paper, we revisit this classic result and describe two new extensions. First, we propose alternate optimization criteria designed to further improve the visual perception of line segment orientations. Second, we develop multi-scale banking, a technique that combines spectral analysis with banking to 45 degrees . Our technique automatically identifies trends at various frequency scales and then generates a banked chart for each of these scales.

One popular and effective approach for addressing such difficulties is to capture successful solutions in design patterns, abstract descriptions of interacting software components that can be customized to solve design problems within a particular context. Based upon a review of existing frameworks and our own experiences building visualization software, we present a series of design patterns for the domain of information visualization. We discuss the structure, context of use, and interrelations of patterns spanning data representation, graphics, and interaction.

Though most research to date assumes a single-user focus on perceptual and cognitive processes, in practice, sensemaking is often a social process involving parallelization of effort, discussion, and consensus building. This suggests that to fully support sensemaking, interactive visualization should also support social interaction. However, the most appropriate collaboration mechanisms for supporting this interaction are not immediately clear.

Although most research to date assumes a single-user focus on perceptual and cognitive processes, in practice, sensemaking is often a social process involving parallelization of effort, discussion, and consensus building. Thus, to fully support sensemaking, interactive visualization should also support social interaction. However, the most appropriate collaboration mechanisms for supporting this interaction are not immediately clear.

However, users may require more nuanced forms of selection. Selecting regions or attributes may be more important than selecting individual items. Selections may be over dynamic items and selections might be more easily created by relaxing simpler selections (e.g., \"select all items like this one\"). Creating such selections requires that interfaces model the declarative structure of the selection, not just individually selected items. We present direct manipulation techniques that couple declarative selection queries with a query relaxation engine that enables users to interactively generalize their selections. We apply our selection techniques in both information visualization and graphics editing applications, enabling generalized selection over both static and dynamic interface objects.

This move is in part due to many businesses recognizing the need for more effective tools for extracting knowledge from the data warehouses they are gathering. Increased mainstream interest is also a result of more exposure to advanced interfaces in contemporary online media. The adoption of information visualization technologies by lay users --- as opposed to the traditional information visualization audience of scientists and analysts --- has important implications for visualization research, design and development. Since we cannot expect each of these lay users to design their own visualizations, we have to provide them tools that make it easy to create and deploy visualizations of their datasets.", "year": "2008", "venue": "Information Visualization", "citations": ["5390afca20f70186a0ed3ba4", "5390b19020f70186a0edf625", "5390b19020f70186a0edfcc7", "5390b68720f70186a0f1d27c", "5390b68720f70186a0f1d27f", "5390b68720f70186a0f1d349", "5390bd1520f70186a0f431c2", "5390bd1520f70186a0f431c8", "558b92b9612c6b62e5e8bd58", "558b015d612c41e6b9d4026d", "558b8d40612c6b62e5e8b574"], "references": ["5390979920f70186a0dffbbb", "5390979920f70186a0dffbc0", "5390979920f70186a0e0029a", "5390979920f70186a0e010c6", "5390979920f70186a0e010d0", "5390979920f70186a0e010d9", "5390980720f70186a0e01af8", "5390980720f70186a0e02986", "5390981d20f70186a0e0489b", "5390981d20f70186a0e048ad", "5390985d20f70186a0e07db9", "539098b820f70186a0e0a1de", "539098dc20f70186a0e0d64e", "539098dc20f70186a0e0d7d6", "539098dc20f70186a0e0d842", "539098dc20f70186a0e0dd8d", "5390990f20f70186a0e1002b", "5390995c20f70186a0e141b0", "5390995c20f70186a0e141ba", "5390995d20f70186a0e14e4e", "539099a220f70186a0e1708a", "539099b320f70186a0e19832", "539099b320f70186a0e1a995", "539099b320f70186a0e1b694", "539099ec20f70186a0e1d6ab", "53909a9320f70186a0e21a9b", "53909a9320f70186a0e2378e", "53909e7c20f70186a0e2bc52", "53909e8a20f70186a0e2cad9", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2eceb", "53909ed120f70186a0e2fe0f", "53909ed120f70186a0e3090d", "53909ed120f70186a0e30949", "53909ed120f70186a0e30cee", "53909f6a20f70186a0e3bc85", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3f777", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3f778", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3f779", "5390a1d420f70186a0e56d22", "5390877f20f70186a0d3132f", "5390878320f70186a0d3386d", "539087aa20f70186a0d4bf89", "539087c320f70186a0d54c0c", "539087d420f70186a0d5dfb1", "539087dd20f70186a0d644d4", "539087e120f70186a0d65891", "539087e720f70186a0d69693", "539087ef20f70186a0d6c519", "539087f320f70186a0d6eba6", "5390880220f70186a0d780fb", "5390880220f70186a0d780f1", "5390880720f70186a0d792d7", "5390881220f70186a0d7f76a", "5390881720f70186a0d8047c", "5390881720f70186a0d80477", "5390881720f70186a0d80495", "5390881720f70186a0d806c5", "539089bb20f70186a0d97714", "539089bb20f70186a0d98f66", "539089d320f70186a0d9c357", "53908a4020f70186a0d9d6a8", "53908af920f70186a0db06b7", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbd0c3", "53908bcc20f70186a0dc6e1b", "53908cde20f70186a0dcd84e", "53908cde20f70186a0dcd852", "53908e0020f70186a0dd49f8", "53908e0020f70186a0dd4b59", "5390956e20f70186a0ded96c", "5390958a20f70186a0def6cd", "539095ba20f70186a0df1842", "539095bb20f70186a0df22fd", "539096cb20f70186a0df6aa0", "5390a25820f70186a0e5f7e6", "5390a45620f70186a0e733d8", "5390a45620f70186a0e733e3", "5390a45620f70186a0e733d0", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e74dae", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e74dab", "5390b61e20f70186a0f14b22", "5390b7ff20f70186a0f276ad", "5390958a20f70186a0def6c9"], "authors": ["Jeffrey Heer", "Frank Ham", "Sheelagh Carpendale", "Chris Weaver", "Petra Isenberg"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a793c60b4bee2de4eecb"}}, {"index": "5390a01420f70186a0e488ae", "title": "Social data analysis workshop", "abstract": "This workshop addresses a new online phenomenon: social data analysis, that is, collective analysis of data supported by social interaction.

Powerful visualization systems may be inflexible or impose abstractions foreign to visual thinking, while graphical systems such as rendering APIs and vector-based drawing programs are tedious for complex work. We argue that an easy-to-use graphical system tailored for visualization is needed. In response, we contribute Protovis, an extensible toolkit for constructing visualizations by composing simple graphical primitives. In Protovis, designers specify visualizations as a hierarchy of marks with visual properties defined as functions of data. This representation achieves a level of expressiveness comparable to low-level graphics systems, while improving efficiency--the effort required to specify a visualization--and accessibility--the effort required to learn and modify the representation.

In this talk, I will highlight recent efforts to use the web as a platform for collectively creating, managing, and analyzing data. I will share how web citizens are collaborating with data, and discuss how we might design systems to catalyze social forms of data management and exploration.", "year": "2009", "venue": "Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["Jeffrey Heer"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a87bc60b4bee2df01110"}}, {"index": "5390ada620f70186a0ec24b0", "title": "Perceptual Guidelines for Creating Rectangular Treemaps", "abstract": "Treemaps are space-filling visualizations that make efficient use of limited display space to depict large amounts of hierarchical data. Creating perceptually effective treemaps requires carefully managing a number of design parameters including the aspect ratio and luminance of rectangles.Moreover, treemaps encode values using area, which has been found to be less accurate than judgments of other visual encodings, such as length. We conduct a series of controlled experiments aimed at producing a set of design guidelines for creating effective rectangular treemaps. We find no evidence that luminance affects area judgments, but observe that aspect ratio does have an effect. Specifically, we find that the accuracy of area comparisons suffers when the compared rectangles have extreme aspect ratios or when both are squares. Contrary to common assumptions, the optimal distribution of rectangle aspect ratios within a treemap should include non-squares, but should avoid extremes. We then compare treemaps with hierarchical bar chart displays to identify the data densities at which length-encoded bar charts become less effective than area-encoded treemaps. We report the transition points at which treemaps exhibit judgment accuracy on par with bar charts for both leaf and non-leaf tree nodes. We also find that even at relatively low data densities treemaps result in faster comparisons than bar charts. Based on these results, we present a set of guidelines for the effective use of treemaps and suggest alternate approaches for treemap layout.", "year": "2010", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics", "citations": ["5390b4c420f70186a0efec4e", "5390b52620f70186a0f033d7", "5390b5ed20f70186a0f0c374", "5390b95420f70186a0f2df0e", "5390baa120f70186a0f39452", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3e0ee", "5390bfa220f70186a0f53c97", "559126e40cf232eb904fb031"], "references": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Kong", "Jeffrey Heer", "Maneesh Agrawala"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a6bec60b4bee2ddb38bf"}}, {"index": "5390aa7620f70186a0eab238", "title": "A Tour through the Visualization Zoo", "abstract": "A survey of powerful visualization techniques, from the obvious to the obscure", "year": "2010", "venue": "Queue - Visualization", "citations": ["5390ad8920f70186a0ec0617", "558b3b9d612c41e6b9d474a0"], "references": [], "authors": ["Jeffrey Heer", "Michael Bostock", "Vadim Ogievetsky"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a734c60b4bee2de05e47"}}, {"index": "5390ada620f70186a0ec24c3", "title": "Declarative Language Design for Interactive Visualization", "abstract": "We investigate the design of declarative, domain-specific languages for constructing interactive visualizations.

We characterize these design differences, together with interactivity and messaging, in terms of the balance between the narrative flow intended by the author (imposed by graphical elements and the interface) and story discovery on the part of the reader (often through interactive exploration).

Most of these charts are only available as bitmap images; without access to the underlying data it is prohibitively difficult for viewers to create more effective visual representations. In response we present ReVision, a system that automatically redesigns visualizations to improve graphical perception. Given a bitmap image of a chart as input, ReVision applies computer vision and machine learning techniques to identify the chart type (e.g., pie chart, bar chart, scatterplot, etc.). It then extracts the graphical marks and infers the underlying data. Using a corpus of images drawn from the web, ReVision achieves image classification accuracy of 96% across ten chart categories. It also accurately extracts marks from 79% of bar charts and 62% of pie charts, and from these charts it successfully extracts data from 71% of bar charts and 64% of pie charts. ReVision then applies perceptually-based design principles to populate an interactive gallery of redesigned charts.

We conducted a within-subjects study to evaluate the efficacy of peripheral paced respiration, as compared to no feedback, in an ecologically valid environment. Participant respiration decreased significantly in the pacing condition. Upon further analysis, we attribute this difference to a significant decrease in breath rate while the intermittent pacing feedback is active, rather than a persistent change in respiratory pattern.

To reduce clutter and improve the readability of node-link views, Holten & van Wijk's force-directed edge bundling employs a physical simulation to spatially group graph edges. While both useful and aesthetic, this technique has shortcomings: it bundles spatially proximal edges regardless of direction, weight, or graph connectivity. As a result, high-level directional edge patterns are obscured. We present divided edge bundling to tackle these shortcomings. By modifying the forces in the physical simulation, directional lanes appear as an emergent property of edge direction. By considering graph topology, we only bundle edges related by graph structure. Finally, we aggregate edge weights in bundles to enable more accurate visualization of total bundle weights.

Ideally, such techniques should surface useful structural features -- such as effective diameter, small-world properties, and structural holes -- not always apparent from either summary statistics or typical network visualizations. In this paper, we present GraphPrism, a technique for visually summarizing arbitrarily large graphs through combinations of 'facets', each corresponding to a single node- or edge-specific metric (e.g., transitivity). We describe a generalized approach for constructing facets by calculating distributions of graph metrics over increasingly large local neighborhoods and representing these as a stacked multi-scale histogram.

Ideally, such techniques should surface useful structural features -- such as effective diameter, small-world properties, and structural holes -- not always apparent from either summary statistics or typical network visualizations. In this paper, we present GraphPrism, a technique for visually summarizing arbitrarily large graphs through combinations of 'facets', each corresponding to a single node- or edge-specific metric (e.g., transitivity). We describe a generalized approach for constructing facets by calculating distributions of graph metrics over increasingly large local neighborhoods and representing these as a stacked multi-scale histogram. Evaluation with paper prototypes shows that, with minimal training, static GraphPrism diagrams can aid network analysis experts in performing basic analysis tasks with network data.

Crowdsourcing offers an alternative approach in which an analyst pays workers to generate such explanations. Yet, asking workers with varying skills, backgrounds and motivations to simply \"Explain why a chart is interesting\" can result in irrelevant, unclear or speculative explanations of variable quality. To address these problems, we contribute seven strategies for improving the quality and diversity of worker-generated explanations. Our experiments show that using (S1) feature-oriented prompts, providing (S2) good examples, and including (S3) reference gathering, (S4) chart reading, and (S5) annotation subtasks increases the quality of responses by 28% for US workers and 196% for non-US workers. Feature-oriented prompts improve explanation quality by 69% to 236% depending on the prompt. We also show that (S6) pre-annotating charts can focus workers' attention on relevant details, and demonstrate that (S7) generating explanations iteratively increases explanation diversity without increasing worker attrition. We used our techniques to generate 910 explanations for 16 datasets, and found that 63% were of high quality. These results demonstrate that paid crowd workers can reliably generate diverse, high-quality explanations that support the analysis of specific datasets.", "year": "2012", "venue": "Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems", "citations": ["5390ba0a20f70186a0f33a45", "5390ba3820f70186a0f350aa", "5390ba3820f70186a0f3563f", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d34a", "5390bda020f70186a0f474c1", "5390bda020f70186a0f474f1", "5390bded20f70186a0f48359", "558afca7612c41e6b9d3fa7a", "558af4b8612c41e6b9d3e854", "558b1b48612c41e6b9d43757", "558b98c1612c6b62e5e8c63f", "558b7260612c03a41325547b", "55915a520cf232eb904fbe03", "55913b9d0cf232eb904fb605", "559135d20cf232eb904fb43f", "559162cf0cf2e89307ca97dc", "55323b8f45cec66b6f9da271"], "references": ["53909f8c20f70186a0e3f777", "53909fbd20f70186a0e43998", "5390a01420f70186a0e482ae", "5390a01420f70186a0e482c1", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4f6a2", "5390a1e620f70186a0e597fd", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6c352", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7f015", "539087b320f70186a0d50c75", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea098f", "5390aa7620f70186a0eabfa5", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb0946", "5390aca920f70186a0eb93d8", "5390ada620f70186a0ec24b0", "5390aefc20f70186a0ecd8e0", "5390afc920f70186a0ed2272", "5390afc920f70186a0ed233e", "5390afc920f70186a0ed24cf", "5390b19020f70186a0ee05cb", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef5a83", "5390958a20f70186a0def6cd", "539087ef20f70186a0d6c51e"], "authors": ["Wesley Willett", "Jeffrey Heer", "Maneesh Agrawala"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a6acc60b4bee2dda607a"}}, {"index": "5390b52620f70186a0f036ce", "title": "Color naming models for color selection, image editing and palette design", "abstract": "Our ability to reliably name colors provides a link between visual perception and symbolic cognition.

In a series of examples, we demonstrate how Termite allows analysts to identify coherent and significant themes.", "year": "2012", "venue": "Proceedings of the International Working Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces", "citations": ["5390bb1d20f70186a0f3e44f", "5390bda020f70186a0f474f1", "558b8c63612c6b62e5e8b490", "558af7c6612c41e6b9d3eef4", "5591717e0cf2e89307ca9d83"], "references": ["539098dc20f70186a0e0d7d6", "5390a45620f70186a0e733de", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82271", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82f43", "5390a74f20f70186a0e8cbd4", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea0963", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea5b37", "5390aaf920f70186a0eada8e", "539087c720f70186a0d56d89", "5390afc920f70186a0ed2281", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef5adc", "5390b52620f70186a0f033ee", "539087d420f70186a0d5df85", "5390958920f70186a0deea5b", "5390962020f70186a0df3aca", "5390b95520f70186a0f2f795"], "authors": ["Jason Chuang", "Christopher D.

Based on 5,611 responses from 69 graduate students describing a corpus of dissertation abstracts, we analyze characteristics of human-generated keyphrases, including phrase length, commonness, position, and part of speech. Next, we systematically assess the contribution of each feature within statistical models of keyphrase quality. We then introduce a method for grouping similar terms and varying the specificity of displayed phrases so that applications can select phrases dynamically based on the available screen space and current context of interaction. Precision-recall measures find that our technique generates keyphrases that match those selected by human judges.

However, understanding and validating the output of these models can itself be a challenging analysis task. In this paper, we offer two design considerations - interpretation and trust - for designing visualizations based on data-driven models. Interpretation refers to the facility with which an analyst makes inferences about the data through the lens of a model abstraction. Trust refers to the actual and perceived accuracy of an analyst's inferences. These considerations derive from our experiences developing the Stanford Dissertation Browser, a tool for exploring over 9,000 Ph.D. theses by topical similarity, and a subsequent review of existing literature. We contribute a novel similarity measure for text collections based on a notion of \"word-borrowing\" that arose from an iterative design process.

However, existing declarative visualization languages are primarily concerned with visual encoding, and rely on imperative event handlers for interactive behaviors. In response, we introduce a model of declarative interaction design for data visualizations. Adopting methods from reactive programming, we model low-level events as composable data streams from which we form higher-level semantic signals. Signals feed predicates and scale inversions, which allow us to generalize interactive selections at the level of item geometry (pixels) into interactive queries over the data domain. Production rules then use these queries to manipulate the visualization's appearance.

However, existing declarative visualization languages are primarily concerned with visual encoding, and rely on imperative event handlers for interactive behaviors. In response, we introduce a model of declarative interaction design for data visualizations. Adopting methods from reactive programming, we model low-level events as composable data streams from which we form higher-level semantic signals. Signals feed predicates and scale inversions, which allow us to generalize interactive selections at the level of item geometry (pixels) into interactive queries over the data domain. Production rules then use these queries to manipulate the visualization's appearance.

Recent studies have shown this simple technique to be surprisingly effective, yet it underutilizes the complementary strengths of precision-oriented humans and recall-oriented machines. We present Predictive Translation Memory, an interactive, mixed-initiative system for human language translation. Translators build translations incrementally by considering machine suggestions that update according to the user's current partial translation. In a large-scale study, we find that professional translators are slightly slower in the interactive mode yet produce slightly higher quality translations despite significant prior experience with the baseline post-editing condition. Our analysis identifies significant predictors of time and quality, and also characterizes interactive aid usage.

We present BodyDiagrams, an online interface for expressing symptoms via drawings and text. BodyDiagrams augment textual descriptions with pain diagrams drawn over a reference body and annotated with severity and temporal metadata. The resulting diagrams can easily be shared to solicit feedback and advice. We also conduct a two-phase user study to assess BodyDiagrams' communicative efficacy. In the first phase, users describe pain symptoms using BodyDiagrams and a text-only interface; in the second phase, medical professionals evaluate these descriptions. We find that patients are significantly more confident that their BodyDiagrams will be correctly interpreted, while medical professionals rated BodyDiagrams as significantly more informative than text descriptions.

User interactions are automatically translated into statements in the Ellipsis DSL. By enabling storytelling without programming, the Ellipsis interface lowers the threshold for authoring narrative visualizations.
