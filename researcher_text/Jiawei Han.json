Techniques for reducing redundant work at each level are studied. In the precompilation level, the optimization techniques include removing redundant parts in a rule cluster, simplifying recursive clusters and sharing common subexpressions among rules. At the iteration level, the techniques discussed are the use of frontier relations and the counting method. At the tuple processing level, we use merging and filtering methods to exclude processed drivers from database reaccessing. Finally, at the file accessing level, I/O cost can be further reduced by level relaxation. We conclude that even for complex recursion, redundant database processing can be considerably reduced or eliminated by developing appropriate algorithms.", "year": "1987", "venue": "SIGMOD '87 Proceedings of the 1987 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data", "citations": ["5390985d20f70186a0e06e93", "539087a520f70186a0d4814e", "539087f320f70186a0d705e7", "5390878a20f70186a0d3733b", "539089d220f70186a0d9a87f", "539089d220f70186a0d9a8fd", "5390879520f70186a0d3fc5c", "5390879920f70186a0d416b6"], "references": ["5390877f20f70186a0d2f892", "5390877f20f70186a0d2fd53", "5390877f20f70186a0d2fd5f", "5390877920f70186a0d2ce69", "5390878320f70186a0d327e2", "5390877920f70186a0d2d1a7", "5390877920f70186a0d2d993", "5390878e20f70186a0d39b0b", "53908a5720f70186a0d9ffc6", "53908a5720f70186a0da08db", "53908a7420f70186a0da45b3"], "authors": ["Jiawei Han", "Lawrence J.

The connecticity between variables is the most critical part in processing recursive formulas.

A new transformation of the N-city M-salesmen MTSP to the standard Traveling Salesmen Problem (TSP) is introduced. The transformed problem is represented by an expanded version of Hopfield-Tank's neuromorphic city-position map with (N + M-1)-cities and a single fictitious salesmen. The dynamic model associated with the problem is based on the Basic Differential Multiplier Method (BDMM) [26] which evaluates Lagrange multipliers simultaneously with the problem's state variables. The algorithm was successfully tested on many problems with up to 30 cities and five salesmen. In all test cases, the algorithm always converged to valid solutions. The great advantage of this kind of algorithm is that it can provide solutions to complex decision making problems directly by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. No learning steps, logical if statements or adjusting of parameters are required during the computation. The algorithm can therefore be implemented in hardware to solve complex constraint satisfaction problems such as the MTSP at the speed of analog silicon VLSI devices or possibly future optical neural computers.", "year": "1989", "venue": "Biological Cybernetics", "citations": [], "references": ["55323b3d45cec66b6f9d998f", "539087f920f70186a0d734f8", "5390878720f70186a0d35a35", "5390878e20f70186a0d3a174", "5390877f20f70186a0d31780", "5390878e20f70186a0d3a7c1", "53908b9320f70186a0dc1660", "5390877f20f70186a0d317c0", "539088b920f70186a0d9141d"], "authors": ["E.

An efficient induction method is developed for learning quantitative rules in relational databases. With the assistance of knowledge about concept hierarchies, data relevance, and expected rule forms, attribute-oriented induction can be performed on the database, which integrates database operations with the learning process and provides a simple, efficient way of learning quantitative rules from large databases. The method involves the learning of both characteristic rules and classification rules. Quantitative information facilitates quantitative reasoning, incremental learning, and learning in the presence of noise. Moreover, learning qualitative rules can be treated as a special case of learning quantitative rules. It is shown that attribute-oriented induction provides an efficient and effective mechanism for learning various kinds of knowledge rules from relational databases.", "year": "1993", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "citations": ["5390979920f70186a0e00a32", "5390990f20f70186a0e102ec", "539099a220f70186a0e1709d", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2df4d", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2eaba", "53909f2d20f70186a0e38f9d", "53909f6a20f70186a0e3bb96", "53909f6a20f70186a0e3bc4c", "53909fbc20f70186a0e414d2", "53909fca20f70186a0e452e6", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4f910", "5390a17720f70186a0e51d80", "5390a2e920f70186a0e67306", "5390a30b20f70186a0e6ab17", "5390a72220f70186a0e88d04", "5390a80f20f70186a0e96b0c", "5390a80f20f70186a0e97826", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea5b94", "5390aa0f20f70186a0ea8517", "5390aa7620f70186a0eaa38f", "5390aa7620f70186a0eaa6a0", "5390aaf920f70186a0ead290", "5390aaf920f70186a0eaea5a", "5390aca820f70186a0eb80df", "5390ad0620f70186a0ebab82", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe914", "5390ad8920f70186a0ebfbc4", "5390ad8920f70186a0ebff0a", "539087c720f70186a0d56e45", "5390af8820f70186a0ecf4e5", "5390b13020f70186a0ede1fe", "5390b24320f70186a0ee6b58", "5390b2d720f70186a0eec815", "5390b36120f70186a0ef11c4", "5390b36120f70186a0ef2748", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef2d93", "5390b44620f70186a0efa155", "5390b48420f70186a0efab76", "5390b4c320f70186a0efd19b", "539087cf20f70186a0d5d5d8", "5390b5df20f70186a0f09d7a", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0a073", "5390b86b20f70186a0f291cc", "5390b86b20f70186a0f29632", "539087dd20f70186a0d644ee", "539087dd20f70186a0d64519", "5390bfa220f70186a0f54520", "558f3c500cf2af9ee80ec2a7", "539087e620f70186a0d674c3", "539087eb20f70186a0d6a44c", "539087ef20f70186a0d6d57d", "539087f820f70186a0d711fe", "539087f820f70186a0d72c85", "5390880220f70186a0d76eb1", "5390880720f70186a0d79c4b", "5390881220f70186a0d7ef59", "5390881820f70186a0d814be", "5390882c20f70186a0d8d83f", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fd5", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa28", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa27", "539089d220f70186a0d9a9f6", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa21", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa24", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa25", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa90", "539089d220f70186a0d9ab05", "539089d220f70186a0d9ab08", "539089d220f70186a0d9ab72", "539089d220f70186a0d9ab7b", "539089d220f70186a0d9abd2", "53908a4020f70186a0d9d48a", "53908a7420f70186a0da242b", "53908a7420f70186a0da3f4b", "53908a7420f70186a0da4548", "53908a9620f70186a0da4a6a", "53908a9620f70186a0da4cda", "53908a9620f70186a0da4cad", "53908a9720f70186a0da6123", "53908a9720f70186a0da63ff", "53908ac620f70186a0da9a1c", "53908ac620f70186a0da9beb", "53908ac620f70186a0da9d27", "53908b1820f70186a0db4818", "53908b2a20f70186a0db8ec5", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc3f8", "53908b4920f70186a0dbccd9", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbd132", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbd5bf", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbd8d7", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbd969", "53908bfb20f70186a0dcb4cb", "53908e0020f70186a0dd4113", "5390958a20f70186a0def871", "539096cb20f70186a0df874d"], "references": ["5390877f20f70186a0d30f5c", "5390878320f70186a0d332df", "5390880720f70186a0d7a4df", "5390878720f70186a0d359c8", "5390878a20f70186a0d36e19", "5390878e20f70186a0d39b0b", "53908a5720f70186a0da02c9"], "authors": ["J.

Combined with query information, the expansion properties of the recursion provide optimized query-processing plans.", "year": "1994", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "citations": ["539089d220f70186a0d9a215"], "references": ["539087a120f70186a0d46d59", "539087a520f70186a0d4814e", "539087ae20f70186a0d4e52b", "5390877f20f70186a0d2fd53", "5390877920f70186a0d2ce69", "5390878320f70186a0d327d6", "5390878320f70186a0d327e1", "5390878320f70186a0d327db", "539087f320f70186a0d705e8", "5390878720f70186a0d34b06", "5390877920f70186a0d2d1a7", "5390878a20f70186a0d3733c", "5390878a20f70186a0d3733b", "5390878e20f70186a0d39346", "539089d220f70186a0d9a87f", "5390878e20f70186a0d3ae78", "5390878e20f70186a0d3b16c", "539089d320f70186a0d9b036", "53908a5720f70186a0da018e"], "authors": ["W.

The system identifies different classes of recursions and compiles recursions into chain or psuedo-chain forms when appropriate. Queries posed to the compiled recursions are analyzed systematically with efficient evaluation plans generated and executed, mainly based on a chained-based query evaluation method. The system has been tested using sophisticated recursions and queries with satisfactory performance. This paper introduces the general design principles and implementation techniques of the system and discusses its strength and limitations.", "year": "1994", "venue": "CIKM '94 Proceedings of the third international conference on Information and knowledge management", "citations": ["5390ad8920f70186a0ebfbc5", "539087f320f70186a0d70f88"], "references": ["539087a520f70186a0d47d8f", "539087a520f70186a0d484f3", "539087aa20f70186a0d4ab39", "5390877f20f70186a0d2f892", "539087b320f70186a0d4eef4", "539087b320f70186a0d4f0d7", "5390877f20f70186a0d2fd53", "539087be20f70186a0d51fdc", "5390878320f70186a0d327db", "5390878e20f70186a0d3a714", "5390879220f70186a0d3bf91", "5390879920f70186a0d40f45", "539087c720f70186a0d56e14", "5390882120f70186a0d868f5", "539089d220f70186a0d9a87f", "539089d220f70186a0d9a8a5", "539089d220f70186a0d9a937", "53908a5720f70186a0da02d1", "53908a9620f70186a0da47c2", "53908a9620f70186a0da4a5e", "53908a9620f70186a0da4b91"], "authors": ["Jiawei Han", "Ling Liu", "Zhaohui Xie"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a89dc60b4bee2df1ebfb"}}, {"index": "53908aac20f70186a0da8af3", "title": "A Case-Based Reasoning Approach for Associative Query Answering", "abstract": "", "year": "1994", "venue": "ISMIS '94 Proceedings of the 8th International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems", "citations": ["5390880720f70186a0d79c4b", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa24"], "references": [], "authors": ["David Wai-Lok Cheung", "Ada Wai-Chee Fu", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a8aec60b4bee2df2cc50"}}, {"index": "539087c720f70186a0d56e45", "title": "DBLearn: a system prototype for knowledge discovery in relational databases", "abstract": "A prototyped data mining system, DBLearn, has been developed, which efficiently and effectively extracts different kinds of knowledge rules from relational databases.

We motivate the general design of Arias and the specific approach to consistency, which is to allow applications to choose the consistency protocol adapted to their data synchronization model. A simple entity, the zone, is introduced, whose management functions constitute the base of a generic support for consistency protocols. This generic support layer is described, and particularly its interface with the specialized consistency protocol modules. We also illustrate the use of this generic support by describing implementation examples of the entry consistency model.", "year": "1995", "venue": "HOTOS '95 Proceedings of the Fifth Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems (HotOS-V)", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["E.

Consequently, the access scope of a query against a class in general includes the access scope of all its subclasses, unless specified otherwise. An index to support superclass-subclass relationship efficiently must provide efficient associative retrievals of objects from a single class or from several classes in a class hierarchy. This paper presents an efficient index called the hierarchical tree (the H-tree). For each class, an H-tree is maintained, allowing efficient search on a single class. These H-trees are appropriately linked to capture the superclass-subclass relationships, thus allowing efficient retrievals of instances from a class hierarchy. Both experimental and analytical results indicate that the H-tree is an efficient indexing structure.", "year": "1996", "venue": "The VLDB Journal \u2014 The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases", "citations": ["539089d220f70186a0d9aae7", "53908b2a20f70186a0db8ce1", "53908b4920f70186a0dbabf2"], "references": ["539087a520f70186a0d48fd5", "539087f820f70186a0d7286a", "5390880720f70186a0d7a46a", "539089ab20f70186a0d96bb1", "539089d220f70186a0d9a880", "5390878e20f70186a0d3ace0", "53908a7420f70186a0da465a", "53908a7420f70186a0da4647", "53908a9620f70186a0da4c41", "53908a9620f70186a0da4c4f", "5390879920f70186a0d41e27"], "authors": ["Beng Chin Ooi", "Jiawei Han", "Hongjun Lu", "Kian Lee Tan"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a779c60b4bee2de3a288"}}, {"index": "539087d420f70186a0d5da9c", "title": "Study on stacking faults and microtwins in wide bandgap II\u2013VI semiconductor heterostructures grown on GaAs", "abstract": "", "year": "1996", "venue": "Journal of Electronic Materials - Special issue on II\u2013VI heterostructures for short wavelength emitters", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["G.

In this paper, we investigate the application of discovered knowledge, concept hierarchies, and knowledge discovery tools for intelligent query answering in database systems. A knowledge-rich data model is constructed to incorporate discovered knowledge and knowledge discovery tools. Queries are classified into data queries and knowledge queries. Both types of queries can be answered directly by simple retrieval or intelligently by analyzing the intent of query and providing generalized, neighborhood or associated information using stored or discovered knowledge. Techniques have been developed for intelligent query answering using discovered knowledge and/or knowledge discovery tools, which includes generalization, data summarization, concept clustering, rule discovery, query rewriting, deduction, lazy evaluation, application of multiple-layered databases, etc. Our study shows that knowledge discovery substantially broadens the spectrum of intelligent query answering and may have deep implications on query answering in data- and knowledge-base systems.", "year": "1996", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "citations": ["53909f2d20f70186a0e38f4d", "5390aa0f20f70186a0ea8517", "5390aca920f70186a0eb989a", "5390aefc20f70186a0ecdeac", "5390b86b20f70186a0f291ca", "5390ba3820f70186a0f369ef", "539087f820f70186a0d71813", "5390880720f70186a0d7a0ac", "539088b820f70186a0d8f98a", "53908a7420f70186a0da310f", "53908ac620f70186a0dabb48", "53908b4920f70186a0dbccbb"], "references": ["5390879d20f70186a0d447dd", "539087a520f70186a0d47d8f", "539087be20f70186a0d51fe4", "539087be20f70186a0d51fe3", "539087e120f70186a0d65550", "539087f820f70186a0d72e0c", "5390878320f70186a0d33cc1", "5390878720f70186a0d359c8", "5390878720f70186a0d361a5", "539089d220f70186a0d9a88d", "5390877920f70186a0d2dd3a", "5390879520f70186a0d3fb05", "5390879920f70186a0d41e15", "53908a4020f70186a0d9dc21", "53908a5720f70186a0da019b"], "authors": ["Jiawei Han", "Yue Huang", "Nick Cercone", "Yongjian Fu"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a829c60b4bee2debc72d"}}, {"index": "539087e120f70186a0d65550", "title": "Attribute-oriented induction in data mining", "abstract": "", "year": "1996", "venue": "Advances in knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390980720f70186a0e0332c", "539099a220f70186a0e18b2e", "53909fca20f70186a0e452e6", "5390a01420f70186a0e477a3", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e54ad4", "5390a2e920f70186a0e67306", "5390a30b20f70186a0e6ad15", "5390a72220f70186a0e89675", "5390a96e20f70186a0ea369d", "5390ad0620f70186a0ebab82", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5461", "5390b0ca20f70186a0edb231", "5390b24320f70186a0ee6b58", "5390b2d720f70186a0eebfef", "5390b2d720f70186a0eec815", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef388c", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef411f", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef7560", "5390b68720f70186a0f1c26c", "5390b86b20f70186a0f291cc", "558e984e0cf222bc17bc1471", "558f38380cf2c779a6478955", "55323b7245cec66b6f9d9eb7", "539087eb20f70186a0d6a44c", "539087f820f70186a0d711d6", "5390880720f70186a0d79c4b", "5390881220f70186a0d7dbb0", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa23", "539089d220f70186a0d9a9f6", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa21", "539089d220f70186a0d9ab7b", "53908a5820f70186a0da178a", "53908a7420f70186a0da3bf6", "53908a9620f70186a0da5582", "53908aac20f70186a0da808d", "53908aac20f70186a0da8998", "53908ac620f70186a0da9ad4", "53908ac620f70186a0da9c84", "53908b1820f70186a0db40bd", "53908b1820f70186a0db4942", "53908b1820f70186a0db49f2", "53908b2120f70186a0db60b1", "53908b2a20f70186a0db9769", "53908b4920f70186a0dba841", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc3f8", "53908b4920f70186a0dbccd9", "53908b4920f70186a0dbccf8", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbd5bf", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbd969", "539096cb20f70186a0df7b3e"], "references": [], "authors": ["Jiawei Han", "Yongjian Fu"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a82dc60b4bee2debfe9d"}}, {"index": "53908a5720f70186a0da08e7", "title": "Maintenance of Discovered Association Rules in Large Databases: An Incremental Updating Technique", "abstract": "An incremental updating technique is developed for maintenance of the association rules discovered by database mining. There have been many studies on efficient discovery of association rules in large databases.

Researchers in many different fields have shown great interest in data mining. Several emerging applications in information providing services, such as data warehousing and on-line services over the Internet, also call for various data mining techniques to better understand user behavior, to improve the service provided, and to increase the business opportunities. In response to such a demand, this article is to provide a survey, from a database researcher's point of view, on the data mining techniques developed recently. A classification of the available data mining techniques is provided, and a comparative study of such techniques is presented.", "year": "1996", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data

Although classification has been studied extensively, few of the known methods take serious consideration of efficient induction in large databases and the analysis of data at multiple abstraction levels. The paper addresses the efficiency and scalability issues by proposing a data classification method which integrates attribute oriented induction, relevance analysis, and the induction of decision trees. Such an integration leads to efficient, high quality, multiple level classification of large amounts of data, the relaxation of the requirement of perfect training sets, and the elegant handling of continuous and noisy data.", "year": "1997", "venue": "RIDE '97 Proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on Research Issues in Data Engineering (RIDE '97) High Performance Database Management for Large-Scale Applications", "citations": ["539099a220f70186a0e18b20", "5390a2e920f70186a0e67975", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea1788", "5390a96e20f70186a0ea32d8", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea60c5", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea7d2f", "5390b13020f70186a0ede1fe", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef6043", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f337b6", "539089ab20f70186a0d97568", "53908a7420f70186a0da3bf6", "53908a7420f70186a0da41bf", "53908a9620f70186a0da50dc", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbd5bf"], "references": [], "authors": ["M.

The behaviour of the web page readers is imprinted in the web server log files. Analyzing and exploring regularities in this behaviour can improve system performance, enhance the quality and delivery of Internet information services to the end user, and identify population of potential customers for electronic commerce. Thus, by observing people using collections of data, data mining can bring considerable contribution to digital library designers. In a joint effort between the TeleLearning-NCE project on Virtual University and NCE-IRIS project on data mining, we have been developing the knowledge discovery tool, WebLogMiner, for mining web server log files.

In effect, this model functions as a black-box, admitting little user interaction in between. We propose, in this paper, an architecture that opens up the black-box, and supports constraint-based, human-centered exploratory mining of associations. The foundation of this architecture is a rich set of constraint constructs, including domain, class, and SQL-style aggregate constraints, which enable users to clearly specify what associations are to be mined. We propose constrained association queries as a means of specifying the constraints to be satisfied by the antecedent and consequent of a mined association.In this paper, we mainly focus on the technical challenges in guaranteeing a level of performance that is commensurate with the selectivities of the constraints in an association query. To this end, we introduce and analyze two properties of constraints that are critical to pruning: anti-monotonicity and succinctness. We then develop characterizations of various constraints into four categories, according to these properties. Finally, we describe a mining algorithm called CAP, which achieves a maximized degree of pruning for all categories of constraints. Experimental results indicate that CAP can run much faster, in some cases as much as 80 times, than several basic algorithms. This demonstrates how important the succinctness and anti-monotonicity properties are, in delivering the performance guarantee.", "year": "1998", "venue": "SIGMOD '98 Proceedings of the 1998 ACM

Many algorithms and applications exist to mine different types of data and extract different types of knowledge. Mining multimedia data is, however, at an experimental stage.We have implemented a prototype for mining high-level multimedia information and knowledge from large multimedia databases. MultiMedia Miner has been designed based on our years of experience in the research and development of a relational data mining system, DBMiner, in the Intelligent Database Systems Research Laboratory, and a Content-Based Image Retrieval system from Digital Libraries, C-BIRD, in the Vision and Media Laboratory.MultiMediaMiner includes the construction of multimedia data cubes which facilitate multiple dimensional analysis of multimedia data, and the mining of multiple kinds of knowledge, including summarization, classification, and association, in image and video databases. The images and video clips used in our experiments are collected by crawling the WWW.

They believe that data mining is most effective when the computer does what it does best--like searching large databases or counting--and users do what they do best, like specifying the current mining session's focus. This division of labor is best achieved through constraint-based mining, in which the user provides restraints that guide a search.

As a first step towards this goal, in [15] we proposed an architecture for supporting constraint-based, human-centered, exploratory mining of various kinds of rules including associations, introduced the notion of constrained frequent set queries (CFQs), and developed effective pruning optimizations for CFQs with 1-variable (1-var) constraints.While 1-var constraints are useful for constraining the antecedent and consequent separately, many natural examples of CFQs illustrate the need for constraining the antecedent and consequent jointly, for which 2-variable (2-var) constraints are indispensable. Developing pruning optimizations for CFQs with 2-var constraints is the subject of this paper. But this is a difficult problem because: (i) in 2-var constraints, both variables keep changing and, unlike 1-var constraints, there is no fixed target for pruning; (ii) as we show, \u201cconventional\u201d monotonicity-based optimization techniques do not apply effectively to 2-var constraints.The contributions are as follows. (1) We introduce a notion of quasi-succinctness, which allows a quasi-succinct 2-var constraint to be reduced to two succinct 1-var constraints for pruning. (2) We characterize the class of 2-var constraints that are quasi-succinct. (3) We develop heuristic techniques for non-quasi-succinct constraints. Experimental results show the effectiveness of all our techniques. (4) We propose a query optimizer for CFQs and show that for a large class of constraints, the computation strategy generated by the optimizer is ccc-optimal, i.e., minimizing the effort incurred w.r.t. constraint checking and support counting.", "year": "1999", "venue": "SIGMOD '99 Proceedings of the 1999 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data", "citations": ["5390981d20f70186a0e06118", "5390985d20f70186a0e07a19", "539098b820f70186a0e0b3ae", "5390990f20f70186a0e0ff56", "5390995d20f70186a0e15fd4", "539099a220f70186a0e18b2f", "539099b320f70186a0e1bacd", "53909a0220f70186a0e1fa02", "53909e8a20f70186a0e2cea9", "53909e8a20f70186a0e2d551", "53909ed120f70186a0e30a79", "53909eef20f70186a0e364d0", "53909f6a20f70186a0e3bbbb", "5390a01420f70186a0e47781", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4adf4", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4d38f", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4d395", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4fab4", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d5ca", "5390a25820f70186a0e5ea2e", "5390a2be20f70186a0e639ae", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6cc17", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e73ff5", "5390a96e20f70186a0ea2221", "5390a9a420f70186a0ea5751", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea6429", "5390aa0f20f70186a0ea8517", "5390aa7620f70186a0eaa433", "5390b24420f70186a0ee78b4", "5390b24420f70186a0ee79bd", "5390b2d720f70186a0eebf73", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef3d17", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef4ab7", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef549b", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef54a6", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef54a4", "5390b48420f70186a0efab67", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0b381", "539087f820f70186a0d71216", "539087fe20f70186a0d75e4e", "5390880720f70186a0d78768", "5390880720f70186a0d78793", "5390880720f70186a0d7879b", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2e2", "5390881220f70186a0d7f514", "5390881220f70186a0d7f511", "5390881720f70186a0d8051e", "5390881720f70186a0d8059e", "5390882d20f70186a0d8e42e", "5390882d20f70186a0d8e42f", "539089ab20f70186a0d95012", "539089d320f70186a0d9c3a8", "53908a4020f70186a0d9dc84", "53908a4020f70186a0d9dc83", "53908a5720f70186a0d9ff8e", "53908a5720f70186a0da0b95", "53908a5820f70186a0da0c27", "53908a9620f70186a0da47e4", "53908a9720f70186a0da649d", "53908aac20f70186a0da8018", "53908b2a20f70186a0db88f5", "53908b4920f70186a0dbb09e", "53908b4920f70186a0dbbf8c", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc416", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbd928", "539090c420f70186a0dde64e", "5390958a20f70186a0deff62", "5390958a20f70186a0deff66", "539095ba20f70186a0df0ebe", "5390962020f70186a0df5c02"], "references": ["539087be20f70186a0d51fe3", "539087c720f70186a0d56bdf", "539087d420f70186a0d5df23", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff6f", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff6d", "539087d920f70186a0d61839", "539087dd20f70186a0d644cc", "539087dd20f70186a0d644ee", "539087e120f70186a0d665fb", "539087e720f70186a0d69654", "539087e720f70186a0d6964e", "539087e720f70186a0d6964d", "539087e720f70186a0d6966a", "53908a5720f70186a0da08e7", "53908a7420f70186a0da4498", "53908a7420f70186a0da4529", "53908a7420f70186a0da449a", "53908a9620f70186a0da4bb0", "53908a9620f70186a0da4cda", "53908a9620f70186a0da4d84", "53908a9620f70186a0da4d99"], "authors": ["Laks V.

Our thesis is that constraint constructs and the optimization they induce play a pivotal role in mining queries, thus substantially enhancing the usefulness and performance of the mining system. This is based on the analogy of declarative query languages like SQL and query optimization which have made relational databases so successful. To this end, our proposed demo is not yet another data mining system, but of a new paradigm in data mining - mining with constraints, as the important first step towards supporting ad-hoc mining in DBMS.In this demo, we will show a prototype exploratory mining system that implements constraint-based mining query optimization methods proposed in [5]. We will demonstrate how a user can interact with the system for exploratory data mining and how efficiently the system may execute optimized data mining queries. The prototype system will include all the constraint pushing techniques for mining association rules outlined in [5], and will include additional capabilities for mining other kinds of rules for which the computation of constrained frequent sets forms the core first step.", "year": "1999", "venue": "SIGMOD '99 Proceedings of the 1999 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data", "citations": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe0f", "5390972920f70186a0dfbe23", "5390981d20f70186a0e0457e", "5390995d20f70186a0e14e5d", "5390a17720f70186a0e52c04", "5390a80f20f70186a0e96b0f", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef54a4", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f34d13", "558aeb64612c41e6b9d3d763", "5390882d20f70186a0d8e430", "539089bb20f70186a0d9967c", "53908a4020f70186a0d9d381", "53908aac20f70186a0da8018", "53908ac620f70186a0da9d1b", "53908b4920f70186a0dbbf8c", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc3d6", "53908bad20f70186a0dc3ded"], "references": ["539087be20f70186a0d51fe3", "539087d920f70186a0d61839", "539087dd20f70186a0d644cc", "539087e120f70186a0d665fb", "539087e720f70186a0d6964e", "539087e720f70186a0d6964d", "539087e720f70186a0d6966a"], "authors": ["Raymond Ng", "Laks V.

Our performance study shows that partial join index hierarchy outperforms several other indexing mechanisms in object-oriented query processing.", "year": "1999", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "citations": ["5390979920f70186a0e012a5", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82e7f", "5390ad0620f70186a0ebaa68", "5390b44620f70186a0ef8d70", "5390880720f70186a0d7a08e", "539089d320f70186a0d9c49a", "53908a9620f70186a0da50f5"], "references": ["5390879d20f70186a0d42c8e", "539087a120f70186a0d45be6", "539087a520f70186a0d48fd5", "539087a520f70186a0d48ff7", "539087ae20f70186a0d4cf2c", "539087ae20f70186a0d4e0a1", "539087be20f70186a0d51feb", "539087d420f70186a0d5df20", "5390877f20f70186a0d31333", "539087d920f70186a0d61c87", "539087f820f70186a0d7286a", "539087f820f70186a0d72d7e", "5390880c20f70186a0d7acee", "5390878e20f70186a0d3972d", "539089d220f70186a0d9a880", "539089d220f70186a0d9a994", "5390878e20f70186a0d3ace0", "5390878e20f70186a0d3ae81", "5390879920f70186a0d40f49", "5390879920f70186a0d41e27", "53908a5720f70186a0da0000", "53908a5720f70186a0da0099", "53908a5720f70186a0da00f6", "53908a5720f70186a0da0369", "53908a5720f70186a0da0408", "53908a5720f70186a0da04a7", "53908a5720f70186a0da068e", "53908a5720f70186a0da0703", "53908a9620f70186a0da49b2", "53908a9620f70186a0da4c41", "53908b4920f70186a0dbac8e", "53908bcc20f70186a0dc598a"], "authors": ["Jiawei Han", "Zhaohui (Alex) Xie", "Yongjian Fu"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a853c60b4bee2dede897"}}, {"index": "5390956e20f70186a0debe55", "title": "A progressive refinement approach to spatial data mining", "abstract": "", "year": "1999", "venue": "A progressive refinement approach to spatial data mining", "citations": ["53909a0220f70186a0e2030d", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e55a7e", "5390a96e20f70186a0ea2210", "5390b2d720f70186a0eebf7f", "5390b44620f70186a0ef886b", "53908a7420f70186a0da3fed", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbd13a"], "references": [], "authors": ["Jiawei Han", "Krzysztof Koperski"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a862c60b4bee2deeb68b"}}, {"index": "539087f820f70186a0d71216", "title": "Breaking the barrier of transactions: mining inter-transaction association rules", "abstract": "", "year": "1999", "venue": "KDD '99 Proceedings of the fifth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["539098b820f70186a0e0ad6e", "539098b820f70186a0e0b335", "539098dc20f70186a0e0e1b4", "5390990f20f70186a0e1031c", "53909ed120f70186a0e30542", "53909f2c20f70186a0e37358", "5390a2e920f70186a0e6723c", "5390a80f20f70186a0e97776", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecb480", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecb481", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef4bc1", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef639c", "5390b44620f70186a0ef9aef", "5390b56a20f70186a0f04ec6", "5390b78a20f70186a0f24090", "5390b7fe20f70186a0f265a7", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f34027", "5390baa120f70186a0f3874a", "5390bfa220f70186a0f542d1", "5390880720f70186a0d787ac", "5390881720f70186a0d8059e", "539089bb20f70186a0d97bf5", "53908a9720f70186a0da6542", "53908b4920f70186a0dbb09e", "53908bad20f70186a0dc3ded"], "references": ["539087be20f70186a0d51fe3", "539087c720f70186a0d56bdf", "539087d420f70186a0d5df23", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff6d", "539087e720f70186a0d6964e", "539087f320f70186a0d6f868", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fc4", "53908a5720f70186a0da07ba", "53908a9620f70186a0da4bb0", "53908a9620f70186a0da4d84", "53908a9620f70186a0da4e48", "53908a9620f70186a0da4d99"], "authors": ["Anthony K.H.

Intratransaction associations are the associations among items with the same transaction, where the notion of the transaction could be the items bought by the same customer, the events happened on the same day, and so on. However, an intertransaction association describes the association relationships among different transactions, such as \u201cif(company) A's stock goes up on day 1, B's stock will go down on day 2, but go up on day 4.\u201d In this case, whether we treat company or day as the unit of transaction, the associated items belong to different transactions. Moreover, such an intertransaction association can be extended to associate multiple contextual properties in the same rule, so that multidimensional intertransaction associations can be defined and discovered. A two-dimensional intertransaction association rule example is \u201cAfter McDonald and Burger King open branches, KFC will open a branch two months later and one mile away,\u201d which involves two dimensions: time and space. Mining intertransaction associations poses more challenges on efficient processing than mining intratransaction associations. Interestingly, intratransaction association can be treated as a special case of intertransaction association from both a conceptual and algorithmic point of view. In this study, we introduce the notion of multidimensional intertransaction association rules, study their measurements\u2014support and confidence\u2014and develop algorithms for mining intertransaction associations by extension of Apriori.

In this paper, we study methods for spatial OLAP, by integration of nonspatial OLAP methods with spatial database implementation techniques. A spatial data warehouse model, which consists of both spatial and nonspatial dimensions and measures, is proposed. Methods for computation of spatial data cubes and analytical processing on such spatial data cubes are studied, with several strategies proposed, including approximation and selective materialization of the spatial objects resulted from spatial OLAP operations. The focus of our study is on a method for spatial cube construction, called object-based selective materialization, which is different from cuboid-based selective materialization proposed in previous studies of nonspatial data cube construction. Rather than using a cuboid as an atomic structure during the selective materialization, we explore granularity on a much finer level, that of a single cell of a cuboid. Several algorithms are proposed for object-based selective materialization of spatial data cubes and the performance study has demonstrated the effectiveness of these techniques.", "year": "2000", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "citations": ["5390972920f70186a0dfba39", "5390979920f70186a0dffd6a", "5390981d20f70186a0e04a0f", "539098dc20f70186a0e0dc2d", "5390995d20f70186a0e14df3", "53909ed120f70186a0e31396", "53909f8220f70186a0e3c2cb", "5390a1d420f70186a0e57526", "5390a1d420f70186a0e586c8", "5390a25820f70186a0e5e957", "5390a25820f70186a0e5fed8", "5390a40520f70186a0e6ee9d", "5390a45520f70186a0e71b6d", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7f0f5", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82e79", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea120a", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea8117", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebca0a", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebccfd", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebd6e7", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed59cd", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5ded", "5390b04120f70186a0ed660c", "5390b13020f70186a0edc970", "5390b13020f70186a0edd73b", "5390b24420f70186a0ee78e8", "5390b2d720f70186a0eec999", "5390b36120f70186a0ef0ec5", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1417", "5390b36120f70186a0ef2640", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef58fa", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef58f9", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef6604", "5390b44620f70186a0ef9bef", "5390b44620f70186a0efa187", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2b571", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f32f06", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f34b5f", "558af847612c41e6b9d3f088", "558b879d612c6b62e5e8ac60", "53908af920f70186a0daff0e"], "references": ["539087d420f70186a0d5df22", "539087d420f70186a0d5f53d", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff83", "539087dd20f70186a0d634a2", "539087dd20f70186a0d644a5", "539087dd20f70186a0d64519", "5390881220f70186a0d7f826", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fba", "539089bb20f70186a0d98ac7", "539089d220f70186a0d9a936", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa22", "53908a5720f70186a0da0719", "53908a5720f70186a0da0686", "53908a7420f70186a0da4478", "53908a9620f70186a0da4ba7", "53908a9620f70186a0da4e45", "53908af920f70186a0dafe66", "53908af920f70186a0dafef1", "53908af920f70186a0dafefb"], "authors": ["Nebojsa Stefanovic", "Jiawei Han", "Krzysztof Koperski"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a565c60b4bede9e9770b"}}, {"index": "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9a45", "title": "Discovering geographic knowledge in data rich environments: a report on a specialist meeting", "abstract": "On 18--20 March 1999, a Specialist Meeting on \"Discovering geographic knowledge in data-rich environments\" was convened under the auspices of the Varenius Project of the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA).

Intratransaction associations are the associations among items with the same transaction, where the notion of the transaction could be the items bought by the same customer, the events happened on the same day, and so on. However, an intertransaction association describes the association relationships among different transactions, such as \u201cif(company) A's stock goes up on day 1, B's stock will go down on day 2, but go up on day 4.\u201d In this case, whether we treat company or day as the unit of transaction, the associated items belong to different transactions. Moreover, such an intertransaction association can be extended to associate multiple contextual properties in the same rule, so that multidimensional intertransaction associations can be defined and discovered. A two-dimensional intertransaction association rule example is \u201cAfter McDonald and Burger King open branches, KFC will open a branch two months later and one mile away,\u201d which involves two dimensions: time and space. Mining intertransaction associations poses more challenges on efficient processing than mining intratransaction associations. Interestingly, intratransaction association can be treated as a special case of intertransaction association from both a conceptual and algorithmic point of view. In this study, we introduce the notion of multidimensional intertransaction association rules, study their measurements\u2014support and confidence\u2014and develop algorithms for mining intertransaction associations by extension of Apriori. We overview our experience using the algorithms on both real-life and synthetic data sets. Further extensions of multidimensional intertransaction association rules and potential applications are also discussed.", "year": "2000", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS)", "citations": ["5390975920f70186a0dfcd7b", "539098b820f70186a0e0b335", "539098dd20f70186a0e0ea50", "539099a220f70186a0e17b8c", "539099b320f70186a0e19a10", "539099b320f70186a0e19e68", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2da07", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2da50", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2ed44", "53909ed120f70186a0e30542", "53909ed120f70186a0e315b3", "53909f2c20f70186a0e37361", "53909f2c20f70186a0e37358", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40369", "53909fca20f70186a0e4532a", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c82d", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4d3cb", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e56301", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e562c5", "5390a30b20f70186a0e69b4c", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f0cb", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75b58", "5390a80f20f70186a0e97776", "5390a96e20f70186a0ea2214", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebb98f", "5390af8920f70186a0ecffee", "5390afc920f70186a0ed1509", "5390b29820f70186a0ee9738", "5390b29820f70186a0ee9713", "5390b36120f70186a0ef101d", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1aa9", "5390b36120f70186a0ef264f", "5390b36120f70186a0ef285a", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef40f5", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef435c", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef4bc1", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef54a6", "5390b44620f70186a0ef870a", "5390b78a20f70186a0f24090", "5390b7fe20f70186a0f265a7", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2b151", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f32f03", "5390baa120f70186a0f3874a", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f3fe9c", "5390881720f70186a0d8059e", "53908a9720f70186a0da6542", "53908b4920f70186a0dbb09e", "539090c420f70186a0dde64e", "539096cb20f70186a0df7a50"], "references": ["539087be20f70186a0d51fe3", "539087c720f70186a0d56bdf", "539087d420f70186a0d5df23", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff6f", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff6d", "539087d920f70186a0d60e48", "539087d920f70186a0d60e56", "539087dd20f70186a0d644cf", "539087dd20f70186a0d644cc", "539087dd20f70186a0d644ee", "539087e120f70186a0d66715", "539087e720f70186a0d6964e", "539087e720f70186a0d6964d", "539087f820f70186a0d72c84", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa24", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa2a", "53908a5720f70186a0d9fff0", "53908a5720f70186a0da08e7", "53908a5720f70186a0da07ba", "53908a5720f70186a0da0b62", "53908a7420f70186a0da4529", "53908a7420f70186a0da449a", "53908a7420f70186a0da45d1", "53908a9620f70186a0da4bb0", "53908a9620f70186a0da4cda", "53908a9620f70186a0da4d80", "53908a9620f70186a0da4d84", "53908a9620f70186a0da4e48", "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9dd6", "53908a9620f70186a0da4d99"], "authors": ["Hongjun Lu", "Ling Feng", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a60fc60b4bee2dd26193"}}, {"index": "5390881220f70186a0d7f511", "title": "Mining frequent patterns by pattern-growth: methodology and implications", "abstract": "", "year": "2000", "venue": "ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter -

In this paper, we study methods for spatial OLAP, by integration of nonspatial OLAP methods with spatial database implementation techniques. A spatial data warehouse model, which consists of both spatial and nonspatial dimensions and measures, is proposed. Methods for computation of spatial data cubes and analytical processing on such spatial data cubes are studied, with several strategies proposed, including approximation and selective materialization of the spatial objects resulted from spatial OLAP operations. The focus of our study is on a method for spatial cube construction, called object-based selective materialization, which is different from cuboid-based selective materialization proposed in previous studies of nonspatial data cube construction. Rather than using a cuboid as an atomic structure during the selective materialization, we explore granularity on a much finer level, that of a single cell of a cuboid. Several algorithms are proposed for object-based selective materialization of spatial data cubes and the performance study has demonstrated the effectiveness of these techniques.", "year": "2000", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "citations": ["5390972920f70186a0dfba39", "5390979920f70186a0dffd6a", "5390981d20f70186a0e04a0f", "539098dc20f70186a0e0dc2d", "5390995d20f70186a0e14df3", "53909ed120f70186a0e31396", "53909f8220f70186a0e3c2cb", "5390a1d420f70186a0e57526", "5390a1d420f70186a0e586c8", "5390a25820f70186a0e5e957", "5390a25820f70186a0e5fed8", "5390a40520f70186a0e6ee9d", "5390a45520f70186a0e71b6d", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7f0f5", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82e79", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea120a", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea8117", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebca0a", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebccfd", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebd6e7", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed59cd", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5ded", "5390b04120f70186a0ed660c", "5390b13020f70186a0edc970", "5390b13020f70186a0edd73b", "5390b24420f70186a0ee78e8", "5390b2d720f70186a0eec999", "5390b36120f70186a0ef0ec5", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1417", "5390b36120f70186a0ef2640", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef58fa", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef58f9", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef6604", "5390b44620f70186a0ef9bef", "5390b44620f70186a0efa187", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2b571", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f32f06", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f34b5f", "558af847612c41e6b9d3f088", "558b879d612c6b62e5e8ac60", "53908af920f70186a0daff0e"], "references": ["539087d420f70186a0d5df22", "539087d420f70186a0d5f53d", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff83", "539087dd20f70186a0d634a2", "539087dd20f70186a0d644a5", "539087dd20f70186a0d64519", "5390881220f70186a0d7f826", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fba", "539089bb20f70186a0d98ac7", "539089d220f70186a0d9a936", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa22", "53908a5720f70186a0da0719", "53908a5720f70186a0da0686", "53908a7420f70186a0da4478", "53908a9620f70186a0da4ba7", "53908a9620f70186a0da4e45", "53908af920f70186a0dafe66", "53908af920f70186a0dafef1", "53908af920f70186a0dafefb"], "authors": ["Nebojsa Stefanovic", "Jiawei Han", "Krzysztof Koperski"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a63fc60b4bee2dd4cf1e"}}, {"index": "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9a45", "title": "Discovering geographic knowledge in data rich environments: a report on a specialist meeting", "abstract": "On 18--20 March 1999, a Specialist Meeting on \"Discovering geographic knowledge in data-rich environments\" was convened under the auspices of the Varenius Project of the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA).

Attribute-oriented induction is a powerful mining technique and has been successfully implemented in the data mining system DBMiner (Han et al. Proc. 1996 Int'l Conf. on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery (KDD'96), Portland, Oregon, 1996). However, its induction capability is limited by the unconditional concept generalization. In this paper, we extend the concept generalization to rule-based concept hierarchy, which enhances greatly its induction power. When previously proposed induction algorithm is applied to the more general rule-based case, a problem of induction anomaly occurs which impacts its efficiency. We have developed an efficient algorithm to facilitate induction on the rule-based case which can avoid the anomaly. Performance studies have shown that the algorithm is superior than a previously proposed algorithm based on backtracking.", "year": "2000", "venue": "Journal of Intelligent Information Systems", "citations": ["5390ad0620f70186a0ebab82", "5390b24320f70186a0ee6b58", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0a073", "5390bed320f70186a0f4e88f", "539090c420f70186a0dde64e", "5390958a20f70186a0def871"], "references": ["539087cf20f70186a0d5d5ee", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff83", "539087dd20f70186a0d634a2", "539087e120f70186a0d65550", "539087e120f70186a0d65523", "5390880720f70186a0d7a4df", "5390881720f70186a0d7fbc0", "53908a4020f70186a0d9dc21", "53908a4020f70186a0d9dc6b", "53908a5720f70186a0da08e7", "53908a5720f70186a0da08f2", "53908a9620f70186a0da4a52", "53908a9620f70186a0da4a6a", "53908a9620f70186a0da4bb0", "53908a9620f70186a0da4cda", "53908a9620f70186a0da4e45", "53908aac20f70186a0da8af3", "5390878720f70186a0d359c8"], "authors": ["David W.

Web access pattern, which is the sequence of accesses pursued by users frequently, is a kind of interesting and useful knowledge in practice. In this paper, we study the problem of mining access patterns from Web logs efficiently. A novel data structure, called Web access pattern tree, or WAP-tree in short, is developed for efficient mining of access patterns from pieces of logs. The Web access pattern tree stores highly compressed, critical information for access pattern mining and facilitates the development of novel algorithms for mining access patterns in large set of log pieces. Our algorithm can find access patterns from Web logs quite efficiently. The experimental and performance studies show that our method is in general an order of magnitude faster than conventional methods.", "year": "2000", "venue": "PADKK '00 Proceedings of the 4th

Most of the previous studies adopt an Apriori-like candidate set generation-and-test approach. However, candidate set generation is still costly, especially when there exist prolific patterns and/or long patterns.In this study, we propose a novel frequent pattern tree (FP-tree) structure, which is an extended prefix-tree structure for storing compressed, crucial information about frequent patterns, and develop an efficient FP-tree-based mining method, FP-growth, for mining the complete set of frequent patterns by pattern fragment growth. Efficiency of mining is achieved with three techniques: (1) a large database is compressed into a highly condensed, much smaller data structure, which avoids costly, repeated database scans, (2) our FP-tree-based mining adopts a pattern fragment growth method to avoid the costly generation of a large number of candidate sets, and (3) a partitioning-based, divide-and-conquer method is used to decompose the mining task into a set of smaller tasks for mining confined patterns in conditional databases, which dramatically reduces the search space. Our performance study shows that the FP-growth method is efficient and scalable for mining both long and short frequent patterns, and is about an order of magnitude faster than the Apriori algorithm and also faster than some recently reported new frequent pattern mining methods.", "year": "2000", "venue": "SIGMOD '00 Proceedings of the 2000 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of

But, what if your friends have not sampled the item of interest? Collaborative filtering (CF) seeks to increase the effectiveness of this process by automating the derivation of a recommendation, often from a clique of advisors that we have no prior personal relationship with. CF is a promising tool for dealing with the information overload that we face in the networked world. Prior works in CF have dealt with improving the accuracy of the predictions. However, it is still challenging to scale these methods to large databases. In this study, we develop an efficient collaborative filtering method, called RecTree (which stands for RECommendation Tree) that addresses the scalability problem with a divide-and-conquer approach. The method first performs an efficient k-means-like clustering to group data and creates neighborhood of similar users, and then performs subsequent clustering based on smaller, partitioned databases. Since the progressive partitioning reduces the search space dramatically, the search for an advisory clique will be faster than scanning the entire database of users. In addition, the partitions contain users that are more similar to each other than those in other partitions. This characteristic allows RecTree to avoid the dilution of opinions from good advisors by a multitude of poor advisors and thus yielding a higher overall accuracy. Based on our experiments and performance study, RecTree outperforms the well-known collaborative filter, CorrCF, in both execution time and accuracy. In particular, RecTree's execution time scales by O(nlog2(n)) with the dataset size while CorrCF scales quadratically.", "year": "2001", "venue": "DaWaK '01 Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery", "citations": ["5390ae2e20f70186a0ec8d7a", "5390b19020f70186a0edef9f", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef57c1", "5390b71120f70186a0f1fccf", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a133", "5390ba3820f70186a0f353e4", "5390ba3820f70186a0f36f7d", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3e15c", "5390bda020f70186a0f47580", "558b79b2612c6b62e5e89725", "558b2b32612c41e6b9d4578f", "558afd37612c41e6b9d3fbfb", "558bd3bb0cf2e30013db190e", "558b5192612c41e6b9d49149", "558c0d510cf25dbdbb05165a", "53908a5820f70186a0da1783", "53908aac20f70186a0da900a"], "references": ["539087c720f70186a0d571b4", "5390b24320f70186a0ee626e", "539087d420f70186a0d5df98", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff7a", "539087dd20f70186a0d628a4", "539087e720f70186a0d69655", "539087e720f70186a0d69653", "539087ef20f70186a0d6c527", "539087f320f70186a0d6f860", "539087f820f70186a0d71391", "539087f820f70186a0d71c9e", "5390880220f70186a0d76493", "539089ab20f70186a0d95188"], "authors": ["Sonny Han Seng Chee", "Jiawei Han", "Ke Wang"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a68cc60b4bee2dd8c705"}}, {"index": "53908a5720f70186a0da0bf8", "title": "Mining Frequent Item Sets with Convertible Constraints", "abstract": "", "year": "2001", "venue": "Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Data Engineering", "citations": ["5390972920f70186a0dfb178", "5390972920f70186a0dfbe0f", "5390975920f70186a0dfcca9", "5390975920f70186a0dfdb27", "5390975920f70186a0dfe3b6", "5390980720f70186a0e03320", "5390981d20f70186a0e06118", "539098b820f70186a0e0b3ae", "5390990f20f70186a0e0ff56", "5390990f20f70186a0e0ff66", "5390990f20f70186a0e0ffc1", "5390995d20f70186a0e15784", "5390995d20f70186a0e15caf", "5390995d20f70186a0e15fd4", "539099a220f70186a0e18b2f", "53909a9320f70186a0e2315e", "53909e8a20f70186a0e2cea9", "53909e8a20f70186a0e2d551", "53909e8a20f70186a0e2d5e8", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2ee54", "53909ed120f70186a0e2fcdb", "53909ed120f70186a0e3052a", "53909ed120f70186a0e30536", "53909f2c20f70186a0e37359", "53909f2c20f70186a0e37a4a", "53909f6a20f70186a0e3bbbb", "53909f8c20f70186a0e400b8", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4d395", "5390a17720f70186a0e52427", "5390a1d420f70186a0e574db", "5390a1d420f70186a0e57f98", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5df54", "5390a25820f70186a0e5ea2e", "5390a2be20f70186a0e63867", "5390a2e920f70186a0e676c3", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f33a", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f738", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e73ff5", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e74068", "5390a54620f70186a0e77610", "5390a6b120f70186a0e83d7a", "5390a80f20f70186a0e97b33", "5390a8db20f70186a0e9deef", "5390a96e20f70186a0ea2221", "5390a96e20f70186a0ea2212", "5390a9a420f70186a0ea4e29", "5390a9a420f70186a0ea575b", "5390a9a420f70186a0ea5751", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea6429", "5390aa7620f70186a0eac3f2", "5390aaf920f70186a0eada71", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb1493", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe653", "5390b04120f70186a0ed860b", "5390b13020f70186a0edd484", "5390b13020f70186a0edd7bd", "5390b24420f70186a0ee78b5", "5390b24420f70186a0ee78c8", "5390b24420f70186a0ee78b9", "5390b36120f70186a0ef11c2", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef3d17", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef4a86", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef4af4", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef4ab7", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef549b", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef54a4", "5390b44620f70186a0ef9897", "5390b44620f70186a0ef9bd8", "5390b48420f70186a0efbf80", "5390b4c320f70186a0efd6fb", "5390b4c420f70186a0efed92", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e297", "5390b86b20f70186a0f285cf", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a0f6", "5390b8d620f70186a0f2ac85", "5390b9d520f70186a0f316a2", "5390b9d520f70186a0f31794", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f32aa2", "5390baa120f70186a0f37f23", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f3fdab", "5390bed320f70186a0f4da39", "5390bf1320f70186a0f51b0b", "558afbe2612c41e6b9d3f935", "559256050cf2aff368683c38", "5390881220f70186a0d7f511", "5390881720f70186a0d8051e", "5390881720f70186a0d8059e", "5390881820f70186a0d8118d", "5390882d20f70186a0d8e42e", "5390882d20f70186a0d8e42f", "5390893e20f70186a0d93028", "53908a9620f70186a0da491c", "53908a9620f70186a0da5954", "53908aac20f70186a0da788b", "53908aac20f70186a0da81b1", "53908ac620f70186a0da99f9", "53908ac620f70186a0da9d1c", "53908b1820f70186a0db4b45", "53908b4920f70186a0dbbf8c", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc3d6", "53908bad20f70186a0dc3def", "539090c420f70186a0dde64e", "5390958a20f70186a0defdc7", "5390958a20f70186a0deff62", "5390958a20f70186a0deff66", "5390958a20f70186a0df03cd", "539095ba20f70186a0df0ebe", "5390962020f70186a0df4cc4", "5390962020f70186a0df5c02"], "references": [], "authors": ["Jian Pei", "Jiawei Han", "Laks V.

However, it still suffers from the huge set of mined rules and sometimes biased classification or overfitting since the classificationis based on only single high-confidence rule. In this study, we propose new associative classification method, CMAR, i.e., Classification based on Multiple Association Rules. The method extends an efficient frequent pattern mining method, FP-growth ,constructs classdistribution-associated FP-tree, and mines large database efficiently. Moreover, it applies CR-tree structure to store and retrieve mined association rulesefficiently, and prunes rules effectively based on confidence, correlation and database coverage. The classification is performed based on weighted X2 analysis using multiple strong association rules. Our extensive experiments on 26 databases from UCI machine learning database repository show that CMAR is consistent, highly effective at classificationof various kinds of databases and has better average classificationaccuracy in comparison with CBA and C4.5.Moreover,our performancestudy shows that the method is highly efficient and scalable in comparison with other reported associative

mining", "abstract": "Sequential pattern mining, which finds the set of frequent subsequences in sequence databases, is an important data-mining task and has broad applications. Usually, sequence patterns are associated with different circumstances, and such circumstances form a multiple dimensional space. For example, customer purchase sequences are associated with region, time, customer group, and others. It is interesting and useful to mine sequential patterns associated with multi-dimensional information.In this paper, we propose the theme of multi-dimensional sequential pattern mining, which integrates the multidimensional analysis and sequential data mining. We also thoroughly explore efficient methods for multi-dimensional sequential pattern mining.

Although the concept of local outliers is a useful one, the computation of LOF values for every data objects requires a large number of &kgr;-nearest neighbors searches and can be computationally expensive. Since most objects are usually not outliers, it is useful to provide users with the option of finding only n most outstanding local outliers, i.e., the top-n data objects which are most likely to be local outliers according to their LOFs. However, if the pruning is not done carefully, finding top-n outliers could result in the same amount of computation as finding LOF for all objects. In this paper, we propose a novel method to efficiently find the top-n local outliers in large databases. The concept of \"micro-cluster\" is introduced to compress the data. An efficient micro-cluster-based local outlier mining algorithm is designed based on this concept. As our algorithm can be adversely affected by the overlapping in the micro-clusters, we proposed a meaningful cut-plane solution for overlapping data. The formal analysis and experiments show that this method can achieve good performance in finding the most outstanding local outliers.", "year": "2001", "venue": "Proceedings of the seventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390979920f70186a0e00fef", "5390985d20f70186a0e07052", "5390985d20f70186a0e07049", "5390990f20f70186a0e102eb", "539099b320f70186a0e19a0c", "539099b320f70186a0e19a2e", "539099b320f70186a0e1bacf", "53909ed120f70186a0e30544", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe49", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40204", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40d54", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40d52", "53909fbc20f70186a0e4193b", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4eabc", "5390a17720f70186a0e52442", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e54e14", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e5640b", "5390a1d420f70186a0e57fd5", "5390a2e920f70186a0e676c4", "5390a30b20f70186a0e698b9", "5390a40520f70186a0e6eeb7", "5390a40520f70186a0e6fcc9", "5390a45520f70186a0e718d2", "5390a45520f70186a0e71c9f", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e74ff8", "5390a63c20f70186a0e81577", "5390a80f20f70186a0e97b55", "5390a8dc20f70186a0e9e52a", "5390a96e20f70186a0ea221c", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea6b87", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea6db9", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea78a9", "5390aa7620f70186a0eaa3cd", "5390aa7620f70186a0eaa57e", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb19a7", "5390ac1820f70186a0eb3dbe", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba34f", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec8a8a", "5390af8920f70186a0ed0891", "5390b0ca20f70186a0edb11f", "5390b19020f70186a0edff44", "5390b29820f70186a0eeaea4", "5390b29820f70186a0eeb06c", "5390b2d720f70186a0eec0d3", "5390b36120f70186a0ef264c", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef4c27", "5390b4c320f70186a0efdc0d", "5390b78a20f70186a0f232f2", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2888a", "5390b95520f70186a0f2f679", "5390bae520f70186a0f3bbc0", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d13b", "5390be6620f70186a0f4d103", "558b2b4e612c41e6b9d457e2", "558c0af80cf2e30013db4b16", "53908b4920f70186a0dbbefb", "53908cde20f70186a0dce1e5", "5390958a20f70186a0df05d7", "539095bb20f70186a0df25eb", "539096cb20f70186a0df7436"], "references": ["539087d920f70186a0d5ff7a", "539087e720f70186a0d69653", "5390880220f70186a0d75ee5", "5390880220f70186a0d75f14", "53908a7420f70186a0da45cd", "53908a9620f70186a0da4ba7", "53908a9620f70186a0da4e4a"], "authors": ["Wen Jin", "Anthony K.

Computing an iceberg cube, which contains only aggregates above certain thresholds, is an effective way to derive nontrivial multi-dimensional aggregations for OLAP and data mining.In this paper, we study efficient methods for computing iceberg cubes with some popularly used complex measures, such as average, and develop a methodology that adopts a weaker but anti-monotonic condition for testing and pruning search space. In particular, for efficient computation of iceberg cubes with the average measure, we propose a top-k average pruning method and extend two previously studied methods, Apriori and BUC, to Top-k Apriori and Top-k BUC. To further improve the performance, an interesting hypertree structure, called H-tree, is designed and a new iceberg cubing method, called Top-k H-Cubing, is developed. Our performance study shows that Top-k BUC and Top-k H-Cubing are two promising candidates for scalable computation, and Top-k H-Cubing has better performance in most cases.", "year": "2001", "venue": "SIGMOD '01 Proceedings of the 2001 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data", "citations": ["5390972920f70186a0dfacd2", "5390972920f70186a0dface4", "5390972920f70186a0dfb178", "5390975920f70186a0dfdb27", "5390979920f70186a0e0139e", "5390980720f70186a0e03320", "5390981d20f70186a0e0455d", "539098dc20f70186a0e0e1fb", "5390990f20f70186a0e106cb", "5390995d20f70186a0e14df3", "539099a220f70186a0e18004", "539099ec20f70186a0e1cb22", "539099ec20f70186a0e1cb38", "539099ec20f70186a0e1cb47", "539099ec20f70186a0e1cb46", "53909a0220f70186a0e1f099", "53909a9320f70186a0e2202b", "53909a9320f70186a0e22639", "53909ee020f70186a0e31eee", "53909f2c20f70186a0e3735d", "53909f2c20f70186a0e37a4a", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a07d", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a980", "53909f6920f70186a0e3aa42", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a97e", "53909f6a20f70186a0e3bba5", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe47", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe4b", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401ba", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c6d3", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c70b", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4d392", "5390a1d420f70186a0e5869a", "5390a2e920f70186a0e676c5", "5390a2e920f70186a0e67b31", "5390a30b20f70186a0e68d65", "5390a30b20f70186a0e6aac1", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6bc01", "5390a40520f70186a0e6eec2", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f78f", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e759b5", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82057", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82830", "5390a72220f70186a0e892df", "5390a72220f70186a0e89735", "5390a74f20f70186a0e8d8db", "5390a7f620f70186a0e94ae1", "5390a96e20f70186a0ea221e", "5390a96f20f70186a0ea3c5b", "5390a9a420f70186a0ea4c46", "5390a9a420f70186a0ea4ea2", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea5bf3", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea6235", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab7f6", "5390aca820f70186a0eb894e", "5390ad0620f70186a0ebaa6b", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecb0dd", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecb38e", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecbcca", "5390af8920f70186a0ecfd3d", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed453c", "5390b0ca20f70186a0edb90e", "5390b2d620f70186a0eeb9ed", "5390b2fc20f70186a0eee86f", "5390b36120f70186a0ef0ece", "5390b36120f70186a0ef0ed0", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1013", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef38b1", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef3e2c", "5390b44620f70186a0ef9bd8", "5390b44620f70186a0ef9bec", "5390b64020f70186a0f19bbc", "5390b86b20f70186a0f291de", "5390881720f70186a0d80507", "5390881720f70186a0d8059e", "5390882d20f70186a0d8dae6", "53908a9620f70186a0da491c", "53908aac20f70186a0da8ff2", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbd928", "5390958a20f70186a0df05bf", "5390962020f70186a0df4cc8"], "references": ["539087d920f70186a0d5ff83", "539087dd20f70186a0d634a2", "539087dd20f70186a0d644a5", "539087e720f70186a0d6964e", "539087f320f70186a0d6f868", "539087f320f70186a0d6f879", "5390880220f70186a0d75ed5", "5390880720f70186a0d7879b", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fba", "53908a7420f70186a0da4478", "53908a7420f70186a0da45d1", "53908a9620f70186a0da4bb0", "53908a9620f70186a0da4e45"], "authors": ["Jiawei Han", "Jian Pei", "Guozhu Dong", "Ke Wang"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a89cc60b4bee2df1d8bc"}}, {"index": "53908a5820f70186a0da11d5", "title": "H-Mine: Hyper-Structure Mining of Frequent Patterns in Large Databases", "abstract": "Methods for efficient mining of frequent patterns have been studied extensively by many researchers.

A distinct feature of this method is that it has very limitedand precisely predictable space overhead and runs really fast in memory-based setting. Moreover, it ca be scaled up to very large databases by database partitioning, and whenthe data set becomes dense,(conditional)FP-trees can be constructed dynamically as part of the mining process. Our study shows that H-mine has high performance in various kinds of data, outperforms the previously developedalgorithms in different settings, and is highly scalable in mining large databases.

A scalable constraint-clustering algorithm is developed in this study which starts by finding an initial solution that satisfies user-specified constraints and then refines the solution by performing confined object movements under constraints. Our algorithm consists of two phases: pivot movement and deadlock resolution. For both phases, we show that finding the optimal solution is NP-hard. We then propose several heuristics and show how our algorithm can scale up for large data sets using the heuristic of micro-cluster sharing. By experiments, we show the effectiveness and efficiency of the heuristics.", "year": "2001", "venue": "ICDT '01 Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Database Theory", "citations": ["53909ee020f70186a0e31e62", "5390a7f520f70186a0e93e61", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebd185", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec5264", "5390aeba20f70186a0eca42e", "5390af8920f70186a0ecf771", "5390b1d220f70186a0ee127b", "5390b2fc20f70186a0eee330", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1372", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef6055", "5390b48420f70186a0efc541", "5390b48420f70186a0efc5d3", "5390b48420f70186a0efc5d2", "5390b7ff20f70186a0f27900", "5390b9d520f70186a0f30e51", "5390be6620f70186a0f4cbf0", "558bd44a0cf23f2dfc593e11", "558cab9c0cf2a44995718bc5", "53908a5720f70186a0da0b95", "53908ac620f70186a0da9d1a", "5390958a20f70186a0defde4", "5390962020f70186a0df4cbc"], "references": ["539087d920f70186a0d5ff7a", "539087e120f70186a0d65789", "539087e720f70186a0d69655", "539087e720f70186a0d6964e", "539087f320f70186a0d6f868", "5390880720f70186a0d79fa2", "539088b920f70186a0d9141d", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fd7", "539089bb20f70186a0d9967f", "53908a5720f70186a0da0b95", "53908a9620f70186a0da4ba7", "53908b2a20f70186a0db9747"], "authors": ["Anthony K.

Our algorithm is fundamentally different from those proposed in the past in that it opportunistically chooses between two different structures, array-based or tree-based, to represent projected transaction subsets, and heuristically decides to build unfiltered pseudo projection or to make a filtered copy according to features of the subsets. More importantly, we propose novel methods to build tree-based pseudo projections and array-based unfiltered projections for projected transaction subsets, which makes our algorithm both CPU time efficient and memory saving. Basically, the algorithm grows the frequent item set tree by depth first search, whereas breadth first search is used to build the upper portion of the tree if necessary. We test our algorithm versus several other algorithms on real world datasets, such as BMS-POS, and on IBM artificial datasets. The empirical results show that our algorithm is not only the most efficient on both sparse and dense databases at all levels of support threshold, but also highly scalable to very large databases.", "year": "2002", "venue": "Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390980720f70186a0e025da", "5390985d20f70186a0e08064", "5390990f20f70186a0e0fdac", "5390995d20f70186a0e15caf", "539099a220f70186a0e17b8c", "539099ec20f70186a0e1cc2f", "53909a9320f70186a0e22633", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2ed44", "53909f2c20f70186a0e37359", "53909f2d20f70186a0e3845a", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40e87", "5390a05920f70186a0e49ba8", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4d395", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4fac1", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5df54", "5390a2e920f70186a0e6755e", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e73ff5", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea623c", "5390aca820f70186a0eb88ae", "5390aefb20f70186a0eccafa", "5390b24320f70186a0ee6b94", "5390b24420f70186a0ee78e3", "5390b36120f70186a0ef11c3", "5390b36120f70186a0ef2770", "5390b36120f70186a0ef2772", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef4ae9", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef51fd", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0a5be", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2b370", "5390be6620f70186a0f4bf42", "539089ab20f70186a0d96afd", "53908bad20f70186a0dc3def", "5390958a20f70186a0df05c3", "5390958a20f70186a0df05fe", "5390958a20f70186a0df05d0", "539095ba20f70186a0df0ebe", "539095bb20f70186a0df25de", "5390962020f70186a0df4cc4"], "references": ["539087be20f70186a0d51fe3", "539087d420f70186a0d5df23", "539087dd20f70186a0d644ca", "539087e720f70186a0d69654", "5390880220f70186a0d75ed5", "5390880720f70186a0d78768", "5390880d20f70186a0d7d1fb", "5390881720f70186a0d804f0", "53908a4020f70186a0d9f4a2", "53908a5720f70186a0da0c06", "53908a5820f70186a0da11d5", "53908a9620f70186a0da4cda", "53908a9620f70186a0da4d80", "53908a9620f70186a0da4bb0", "53908a9620f70186a0da4d99"], "authors": ["Junqiang Liu", "Yunhe Pan", "Ke Wang", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a6d7c60b4bee2ddc3e4c"}}, {"index": "53908b4920f70186a0dbc3ea", "title": "PEBL: positive example based learning for Web page classification using SVM", "abstract": "Web page classification is one of the essential techniques for Web mining. Specifically, classifying Web pages of a user-interesting class is the first step of mining interesting information from the Web. However, constructing a classifier for an interesting class requires laborious pre-processing such as collecting positive and negative training examples. For instance, in order to construct a \"homepage\" classifier, one needs to collect a sample of homepages (positive examples) and a sample of non-homepages (negative examples). In particular, collecting negative training examples requires arduous work and special caution to avoid biasing them. We introduce in this paper the Positive Example Based Learning (PEBL) framework for Web page classification which eliminates the need for manually collecting negative training examples in pre-processing. We present an algorithm called Mapping-Convergence (M-C) that achieves classification accuracy (with positive and unlabeled data) as high as that of traditional SVM (with positive and negative data). Our experiments show that when the M-C algorithm uses the same amount of positive examples as that of traditional SVM, the M-C algorithm performs as well as traditional SVM.", "year": "2002", "venue": "Proceedings of the eighth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbc7a", "5390981d20f70186a0e0454f", "5390990f20f70186a0e0f634", "5390990f20f70186a0e0fdab", "5390990f20f70186a0e107a6", "53909ed120f70186a0e30b31", "53909eef20f70186a0e3615d", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a148", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4cbc5", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4d38f", "5390a17720f70186a0e53adf", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e56417", "5390a1d420f70186a0e56945", "5390a2be20f70186a0e64fcb", "5390a2e920f70186a0e67585", "5390a40520f70186a0e6fca1", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75071", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e752b5", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7e69e", "5390a63c20f70186a0e81603", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82843", "5390a6b120f70186a0e85006", "5390a6b120f70186a0e86005", "5390a6b120f70186a0e86002", "5390a6d920f70186a0e8833a", "5390a74f20f70186a0e8bbdb", "5390a77d20f70186a0e8ef33", "5390a7f620f70186a0e94f2c", "5390a96e20f70186a0ea2d46", "5390a96f20f70186a0ea4824", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea7867", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea7860", "5390aca820f70186a0eb7bb0", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba639", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebd0c8", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec686b", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec8f3e", "5390aefc20f70186a0ecdf89", "5390b04120f70186a0ed7f05", "5390b13020f70186a0eddd84", "5390b19020f70186a0edeeb4", "5390b20120f70186a0ee5271", "5390b24420f70186a0ee7bb4", "5390b29820f70186a0eeaf1f", "5390b2d720f70186a0eec3f6", "5390b2d720f70186a0eecd9d", "5390b36120f70186a0ef26c5", "5390b36120f70186a0ef28b5", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef416d", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef5474", "5390b48420f70186a0efbbdb", "5390b52620f70186a0f03754", "5390b5ed20f70186a0f0d327", "5390b78a20f70186a0f232ad", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a727", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2baf3", "5390b9d520f70186a0f30b05", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d2ea", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f4098a", "5390bda020f70186a0f46621", "558af948612c41e6b9d3f2d0", "558b942d612c6b62e5e8bfb6", "558b02b7612c41e6b9d4045f", "539089ab20f70186a0d96afd", "539089bb20f70186a0d9989a", "5390958a20f70186a0defd98", "5390958a20f70186a0defdce", "5390958a20f70186a0df0498", "5390958a20f70186a0df05ca", "5390958a20f70186a0df05d7", "539095ba20f70186a0df0968", "539095ba20f70186a0df09f8"], "references": ["539087cf20f70186a0d5cd8f", "539087ef20f70186a0d6da64", "539087f820f70186a0d7136e", "5390880220f70186a0d78212", "5390880220f70186a0d78213", "5390880720f70186a0d78799", "5390880720f70186a0d78970", "5390880720f70186a0d79ef2", "53908a4020f70186a0d9f221", "53908a5820f70186a0da10f2", "53908bcc20f70186a0dc5df3", "5390958920f70186a0dee9fe", "5390958920f70186a0dee9c7", "5390958920f70186a0dee9ff"], "authors": ["Hwanjo Yu", "Jiawei Han", "Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a6d9c60b4bee2ddc5216"}}, {"index": "53908bde20f70186a0dc945b", "title": "On Computing Condensed Frequent Pattern Bases", "abstract": "Frequent pattern mining has been studied extensively.However, the effectiveness and efficiency of this mining isoften limited, since the number of frequent patterns generatedis often too large.

For example, in a protein sequence, the amino acid N is likely to mutate to D with little impact to the biological function of the protein. It would be desirable if the occurrence of D in the observation can be related to a possible mutation from N in an appropriate manner. Unfortunately, the support measure (i.e., the number of occurrences) of a pattern does not serve this purpose. In this paper, we introduce the concept of compatibility matrix as the means to provide a probabilistic connection from the observation to the underlying true value. A new metric match is also proposed to capture the \"real support\" of a pattern which would be expected if a noise-free environment is assumed. In addition, in the context we address, a pattern could be very long. The standard pruning technique developed for the market basket problem may not work efficiently. As a result, a novel algorithm that combines statistical sampling and a new technique (namely border collapsing) is devised to discover long patterns in a minimal number of scans of the sequence database with sufficiently high confidence. Empirical results demonstrate the robustness of the match model (with respect to the noise) and the efficiency of the probabilistic algorithm.", "year": "2002", "venue": "Proceedings of the 2002 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data", "citations": ["5390975920f70186a0dfe3b6", "5390979920f70186a0dffa64", "539098dc20f70186a0e0e20c", "5390990f20f70186a0e0ff4e", "5390995d20f70186a0e159da", "539099a220f70186a0e17ccc", "539099a220f70186a0e18216", "53909a0220f70186a0e1f090", "53909e7c20f70186a0e2c608", "53909e8a20f70186a0e2cb81", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2da1e", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2ee54", "53909ed120f70186a0e2f5be", "53909f2c20f70186a0e37a51", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe06", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe2b", "53909fca20f70186a0e459dc", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4a75a", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c449", "5390a17720f70186a0e52434", "5390a17720f70186a0e5243f", "5390a17720f70186a0e5265c", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e548a7", "5390a25820f70186a0e5fddf", "5390a2be20f70186a0e64816", "5390a2e920f70186a0e67b9c", "5390a30b20f70186a0e6ab1e", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6bc5e", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f037", "5390a45520f70186a0e717b3", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75105", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7e981", "5390a6b220f70186a0e86172", "5390a72220f70186a0e892e0", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea1cbb", "5390ad0620f70186a0ebab74", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebdcaf", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecb0b3", "5390b0ca20f70186a0edb11a", "5390b29820f70186a0ee9331", "5390b29820f70186a0ee9824", "5390b2fc20f70186a0eef969", "5390b36120f70186a0ef106a", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef323e", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0ba78", "5390b9d520f70186a0f31794", "5390b9d520f70186a0f3213b", "5390bfa220f70186a0f542a3", "539089ab20f70186a0d96afd", "5390958a20f70186a0defdcd", "5390958a20f70186a0defdf2", "5390962020f70186a0df4cbb", "5390962020f70186a0df4cba", "5390962020f70186a0df4cd1"], "references": ["539087c720f70186a0d56dd9", "5390877f20f70186a0d3135f", "539087e720f70186a0d69654", "5390880220f70186a0d75ed5", "5390880720f70186a0d7878b", "5390880720f70186a0d7879c", "5390880720f70186a0d78761", "5390880d20f70186a0d7d1be", "5390881220f70186a0d7f517", "5390881720f70186a0d804ef", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fc4", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fc3", "53908a4020f70186a0d9f4a2", "53908a4020f70186a0d9f494", "53908a5720f70186a0da09ae", "53908a5720f70186a0da07ba", "53908a5720f70186a0da0ae5", "53908a5720f70186a0da0c06", "53908a7420f70186a0da4681", "53908a9620f70186a0da4bb0", "53908a9620f70186a0da4d84", "53908b2a20f70186a0db94c6", "53908bcc20f70186a0dc59a3", "53908a9620f70186a0da4d99"], "authors": ["Jiong Yang", "Wei Wang", "Philip S.

With the guidance of templates, several optimization techniques, i.e., joining, converging, and speeding, are devised to speed up the discovery of inter-transactional association rules.

To this end, this paper has three main contributions. First, we propose a new clustering method called CLARANS, whose aim is to identify spatial structures that may be present in the data. Experimental results indicate that, when compared with existing clustering methods, CLARANS is very efficient and effective. Second, we investigate how CLARANS can handle not only points objects, but also polygon objects efficiently. One of the methods considered, called the IR-approximation, is very efficient in clustering convex and nonconvex polygon objects. Third, building on top of CLARANS, we develop two spatial data mining algorithms that aim to discover relationships between spatial and nonspatial attributes. Both algorithms can discover knowledge that is difficult to find with existing spatial data mining algorithms.", "year": "2002", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "citations": ["5390980720f70186a0e0332f", "5390990f20f70186a0e0ff51", "539099a220f70186a0e17d77", "539099a220f70186a0e17f89", "539099b320f70186a0e1baf0", "539099ec20f70186a0e1cea4", "53909e7c20f70186a0e2c69e", "53909e8a20f70186a0e2cb74", "53909e8a20f70186a0e2cc13", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2f149", "53909f6a20f70186a0e3bb84", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3f7ba", "53909fbd20f70186a0e42692", "53909fca20f70186a0e45efa", "5390a01420f70186a0e478f5", "5390a05920f70186a0e49d0a", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4b4b2", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4cfa9", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e54cb8", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e5661e", "5390a1d420f70186a0e579f9", "5390a1e620f70186a0e596dc", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d3d4", "5390a25820f70186a0e5e859", "5390a25820f70186a0e5fed8", "5390a2be20f70186a0e638cb", "5390a2e920f70186a0e67566", "5390a30b20f70186a0e6aae1", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6c222", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e7406e", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e74066", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e7444b", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75041", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75a39", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7f0f1", "5390a6b120f70186a0e85b39", "5390a6d920f70186a0e8652f", "5390a72220f70186a0e89cb6", "5390a72220f70186a0e8af24", "5390a74f20f70186a0e8b9ff", "5390a74f20f70186a0e8c6af", "5390a74f20f70186a0e8d1d5", "5390a79f20f70186a0e922fc", "5390a7f620f70186a0e94843", "5390a8db20f70186a0e9d9b0", "5390a8db20f70186a0e9db3a", "5390a8dc20f70186a0e9f230", "5390a96e20f70186a0ea2207", "5390a96e20f70186a0ea2e1a", "5390a96e20f70186a0ea32ca", "5390a96f20f70186a0ea3d2c", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea6dca", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea784a", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea788c", "5390ac1720f70186a0eb28bc", "5390aca820f70186a0eb7841", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebb885", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebba7a", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebc6b3", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebd184", "5390ad8920f70186a0ebfeb8", "5390ad8920f70186a0ec0467", "5390aefb20f70186a0ecc485", "5390aefc20f70186a0ecdf3a", "5390afc920f70186a0ed2cc1", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed411f", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed4267", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5265", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed62ec", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda0a4", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda996", "5390b13020f70186a0edc980", "5390b13020f70186a0edd7bb", "5390b13020f70186a0edd89d", "5390b13020f70186a0ede12f", "5390b13020f70186a0ede11f", "5390b19020f70186a0edf32d", "5390b24420f70186a0ee7b7a", "5390b29820f70186a0ee96f1", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef40e0", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef6d8f", "5390b52620f70186a0f0399a", "5390b56a20f70186a0f049e0", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0bf5b", "5390b68720f70186a0f1bd22", "5390b86b20f70186a0f28b93", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2c3bf", "5390b9d520f70186a0f2ff26", "5390b9d520f70186a0f306e6", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f32f18", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f337b6", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f337bd", "5390ba3820f70186a0f35087", "5390ba3820f70186a0f352c1", "5390baa120f70186a0f389ac", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d644", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f4060b", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40b87", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f415a9", "5390bd1520f70186a0f434c1", "5390bda020f70186a0f47add", "5390bf1320f70186a0f50bbd", "558b00bb612c41e6b9d400a9", "5390bfa220f70186a0f54199", "558bcfd10cf20e727d0f1fca", "558b1938612c41e6b9d43284", "559252330cf28b1a968ffb28", "55922cfb0cf2c3a0875c9d3e", "55323b0445cec66b6f9d92cb", "55323bf945cec66b6f9daf24", "55323bfa45cec66b6f9daf55", "55323c0745cec66b6f9db091", "539095ba20f70186a0df0981", "539095ba20f70186a0df1483"], "references": ["539087b320f70186a0d4fe29", "539087be20f70186a0d51fe4", "539087be20f70186a0d51fe6", "539087be20f70186a0d51fe3", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff7a", "539087e720f70186a0d69655", "539087e720f70186a0d69653", "539087f320f70186a0d6f85f", "5390878720f70186a0d34aea", "5390877920f70186a0d2d2c0", "5390882420f70186a0d87859", "5390893e20f70186a0d92c66", "539089bb20f70186a0d9967f", "5390879220f70186a0d3d478", "5390879920f70186a0d41e22", "53908a5720f70186a0da0719", "53908a5720f70186a0da0686", "53908a7420f70186a0da45d5", "53908a9620f70186a0da4908", "53908a9620f70186a0da4a52", "53908a9620f70186a0da4a6a", "53908a9620f70186a0da4ba7", "53908af920f70186a0dafe67", "53908b2a20f70186a0db9747"], "authors": ["Raymond T.

In this paper, we are interested in finding succinct summaries of the data cube, exploiting regularities present in the cube, with a clear basis. We would like the summary: (i) to be as concise as possible, (ii) to itself form a lattice preserving the rollup/drilldown semantics of the cube, and (iii) to allow the original cube to be fully recovered. We illustrate the utility of solving this problem and discuss the inherent challenges. We develop techniques for partitioning cube cells for obtaining succinct summaries, and introduce the quotient cube. We give efficient algorithms for computing it from a base table. For monotone aggregate functions (e.g., COUNT, MIN, MAX, SUM on non-negative measures, etc.), our solution is optimal (i.e., quotient cube of the least size). For nonmonotone functions (e.g., AVG), we obtain a locally optimal solution.

We proposea heterogeneous learning framework for classifying Webpages, which (1) eliminates the need for negative trainingdata, and (2) increases classification accuracy by using twoheterogeneous learners. Our framework uses two heterogeneouslearners - a decision list and a linear separatorwhich complement each other - to eliminate the need fornegative training data in the training phase and to increasethe accuracy in the testing phase. Our results show that ourheterogeneous framework achieves high accuracy withoutrequiring negative training data; it enhances the accuracyof linear separators by reducing the errors on \"low-margindata\".

However, frequent pattern mining often generates a very large number of patterns and rules, which reduces not only the efficiency but also the effectiveness of mining. Recent work has highlighted the importance of the constraint-based mining paradigm in the context of mining frequent itemsets, associations, correlations, sequential patterns, and many other interesting patterns in large databases.Recently, we developed efficient pattern-growth methods for frequent pattern mining. Interestingly, pattern-growth methods are not only efficient but also effective in mining with various constraints. Many tough constraints which cannot be handled by previous methods can be pushed deep into the pattern-growth mining process. In this paper, we overview the principles of pattern-growth methods for constrained frequent pattern mining and sequential pattern mining.

Most of the previously proposed methods adopt apriori-like candidate-generation-and-test approaches. However, those methods may encounter serious challenges when mining datasets with prolific patterns and/or long patterns. In this work, we develop a class of novel and efficient pattern-growth methods for mining various frequent patterns from large databases. Pattern-growth methods adopt a divide-and-conquer approach to decompose both the mining tasks and the databases. Then, they use a pattern fragment growth method to avoid the costly candidate-generation-and-test processing completely. Moreover, effective data structures are proposed to compress crucial information about frequent patterns and avoid expensive, repeated database scans. A comprehensive performance study shows that pattern-growth methods, FP-growth and H-mine, are efficient and scalable. They are faster than some recently reported new frequent pattern mining methods. Interestingly, pattern growth methods are not only efficient, but also effective. With pattern growth methods, many interesting patterns can also be mined efficiently, such as patterns with some tough non-anti-monotonic constraints and sequential patterns. These techniques have strong implications to many other data mining tasks.", "year": "2002", "venue": "Pattern-growth methods for frequent pattern mining", "citations": ["539099ec20f70186a0e1cc2f", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40e86", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea786c", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea7bfb", "5390b52620f70186a0f039ce", "5390bfa220f70186a0f535dc"], "references": [], "authors": ["Jiawei Han", "Jian Pei"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a858c60b4bee2dee28e9"}}, {"index": "53909f6920f70186a0e3a97e", "title": "Multi-dimensional regression analysis of time-series data streams", "abstract": "Real-time production systems and other dynamic environments often generate tremendous (potentially infinite) amount of stream data; the volume of data is too huge to be stored on disks or scanned multiple times.

This is a challenging task. In this paper, we investigate methods for on-line, multi-dimensional regression analysis of time-series stream data, with the following contributions: (1) our analysis shows that only a small number of compressed regression measures instead of the complete stream of data need to be registered for multi-dimensional linear regression analysis, (2) to facilitate on-line stream data analysis, a partially materialized data cube model, with regression as measure, and a tilt time frame as its time dimension, is proposed to minimize the amount of data to be retained in memory or stored on disks, and (3) an exception-guided drilling approach is developed for on-line, multi-dimensional exception-based regression analysis. Based on this design, algorithms are proposed for efficient analysis of time-series data streams.

Two methods, closed_node_count and descendant_sum are proposedto effiectively raise support threshold and prune FP-tree bothduring and after the construction of FP-tree. During themining process, a novel top-down and bottom-up combinedFP-tree mining strategy is developed to speed-up support-raising and closed frequent pattern discovering. In addition,a fast hash-based closed pattern verification scheme has beenemployed to check efficiently if a potential closed pattern isreally closed.Our performance study shows that in most cases, TFPoutperforms CLOSET and CHARM, two efficient frequentclosed pattern mining algorithms, even when both are running with the best tuned min_support. Furthermore, themethod can be extended to generate association rules andto incorporate user-specified constraints. Thus we concludethat for frequent pattern mining, mining top-k frequent closedpatterns without min support is more preferable than thetraditional min_support-based mining.", "year": "2002", "venue": "ICDM '02 Proceedings of the 2002 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining", "citations": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe02", "5390972920f70186a0dfbe53", "5390981d20f70186a0e056fd", "539098b820f70186a0e0a851", "539098b820f70186a0e0ae78", "5390990f20f70186a0e0ff4e", "5390990f20f70186a0e0ff50", "539099b320f70186a0e19a28", "539099b320f70186a0e19a5d", "539099b320f70186a0e19a33", "539099ec20f70186a0e1cb26", "539099ec20f70186a0e1d332", "53909a0320f70186a0e2044d", "53909ed120f70186a0e30650", "53909f2c20f70186a0e37a51", "53909f2d20f70186a0e39507", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a080", "53909f8220f70186a0e3c790", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4b337", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c82d", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4d395", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4def7", "5390a17720f70186a0e5243d", "5390a1d420f70186a0e584fb", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d515", "5390a25820f70186a0e5e859", "5390a25820f70186a0e5fe35", "5390a25820f70186a0e5feb0", "5390a2be20f70186a0e64f8f", "5390a40520f70186a0e700bb", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75012", "5390a4d020f70186a0e7600c", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7e984", "5390a79f20f70186a0e922c2", "5390a80f20f70186a0e97b33", "5390a8db20f70186a0e9daa1", "5390aa7620f70186a0eac3f2", "5390aaf920f70186a0eada72", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebc2eb", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec66e8", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecb0c1", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed546d", "5390b19020f70186a0ee0a55", "5390b24320f70186a0ee6b7a", "5390b29820f70186a0eeaea0", "5390b29820f70186a0eeaea5", "5390b2d720f70186a0eec1b6", "5390b36120f70186a0ef0edb", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1047", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1263", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef4067", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef79c5", "5390b48420f70186a0efc2ce", "5390b4c420f70186a0efe62a", "5390b4c420f70186a0efe634", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e25b", "5390b86b20f70186a0f29601", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a103", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f3362d", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40feb", "5390bda020f70186a0f45fd0", "5390bed320f70186a0f4d950", "5390bf1320f70186a0f51d92", "558b2741612c41e6b9d4508f", "5390958a20f70186a0defdec", "5390958a20f70186a0defdd9", "5390958a20f70186a0df05d0", "5390962020f70186a0df4cd1"], "references": [], "authors": ["Jiawei Han", "Jianyong Wang", "Ying Lu", "Petre Tzvetkov"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a866c60b4bee2deeed96"}}, {"index": "53908b4920f70186a0dbccf8", "title": "Case studies: Public domain, multiple mining tasks systems: DBMiner", "abstract": "DBMiner is an online analytical mining system, developed for interactive mining of multiple-level knowledge in large relational databases and data warehouses (see Chapters 6.1 and 13).

The system facilitates query-based, interactive mining of multidimensional databases (see Chapter 6.3) by implementing a set of advanced data mining techniques, including OLAP-based induction, multidimensional statistical analysis, progressive deepening for mining refined knowledge, meta-rule guided mining, and data and knowledge visualization (see Chapter 20). DBMiner integrates smoothly with commercial relational database and data warehouse systems, and provides a user-friendly, interactive data mining environment with high performance.

Mining characteristic rules and discriminant rules from the data are two essential components in descriptive data mining. In contrast to online analytical processing, data description puts more emphasis on (1) automated processing, helping users determine which dimensions (or attributes) should be included in the analysis and to what abstraction level the data set should be generalized in order to obtain interesting summarization; and (2) handling complex data types. Mining data characteristics and discriminant descriptions can be implemented based on a data cube method or an attribute-oriented induction method.

Previous studies have developed two major approaches, top-down vs. bottom-up. The former, represented by the Multi-Way Array Cube (called MultiWay) algorithm [25], aggregates simultaneously on multiple dimensions; however, it cannot take advantage of Apriori pruning [2] when computing iceberg cubes (cubes that contain only aggregate cells whose measure value satisfies a threshold, called iceberg condition). The latter, represented by two algorithms: BUC [6] and H-Cubing[11], computes the iceberg cube bottom-up and facilitates Apriori pruning. BUC explores fast sorting and partitioning techniques; whereas H-Cubing explores a data structure, H-Tree, for shared computation. However, none of them fully explores multi-dimensional simultaneous aggregation.

Previous studies have developed two major approaches, top-down vs. bottom-up. The former, represented by the Multi-Way Array Cube (called MultiWay) algorithm [25], aggregates simultaneously on multiple dimensions; however, it cannot take advantage of Apriori pruning [2] when computing iceberg cubes (cubes that contain only aggregate cells whose measure value satisfies a threshold, called iceberg condition). The latter, represented by two algorithms: BUC [6] and H-Cubing[11], computes the iceberg cube bottom-up and facilitates Apriori pruning. BUC explores fast sorting and partitioning techniques; whereas H-Cubing explores a data structure, H-Tree, for shared computation. However, none of them fully explores multi-dimensional simultaneous aggregation.

The classic association mining based on a uniform minimum support, such as Apriori, either misses interesting patterns of low support or suffers from the bottleneck of itemset generation caused by a low minimum support. A better solution lies in exploiting support constraints, which specify what minimum support is required for what itemsets, so that only the necessary itemsets are generated. In this paper, we present a framework of frequent itemset mining in the presence of support constraints. Our approach is to \u9a74push\u9a74 support constraints into the Apriori itemset generation so that the \u9a74best\u9a74 minimum support is determined for each itemset at runtime to preserve the essence of Apriori.

streams with concept drifts for actionable insights has become an important and challenging task for a wide range of applications including credit card fraud protection, target marketing, network intrusion detection, etc. Conventional knowledge discovery tools are facing two challenges, the overwhelming volume of the streaming data, and the concept drifts. In this paper, we propose a general framework for mining concept-drifting data streams using weighted ensemble classifiers. We train an ensemble of classification models, such as C4.5, RIPPER, naive Beyesian, etc., from sequential chunks of the data stream. The classifiers in the ensemble are judiciously weighted based on their expected classification accuracy on the test data under the time-evolving environment. Thus, the ensemble approach improves both the efficiency in learning the model and the accuracy in performing classification. Our empirical study shows that the proposed methods have substantial advantage over single-classifier approaches in prediction accuracy, and the ensemble framework is effective for a variety of classification models.", "year": "2003", "venue": "Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe0e",

An intertransaction association describes the association relationships among different transactions. In a database of stock price information, an example of such an association is \"if (company) A's stock goes up on day one, B's stock will go down on day two but go up on day four.\" In this case, no matter whether we treat company or day as the unit of transaction, the associated items belong to different transactions. Moreover, such an intertransaction association can be extended to associate multiple properties in the same rule, so that multidimensional intertransaction associations can also be defined and discovered. Mining intertransaction associations pose more challenges on efficient processing than mining intratransaction associations because the number of potential association rules becomes extremely large after the boundary of transactions is broken. In this study, we introduce the notion of intertransaction association rule, define its measurements: support and confidence, and develop an efficient algorithm, FITI (an acronym for \"First Intra Then Inter\"), for mining intertransaction associations, which adopts two major ideas: 1) an intertransaction frequent itemset contains only the frequent itemsets of its corresponding intratransaction counterpart; and 2) a special data structure is built among intratransaction frequent itemsets for efficient mining of intertransaction frequent itemsets. We compare FITI with EH-Apriori, the best algorithm in our previous proposal, and demonstrate a substantial performance gain of FITI over EH-Apriori. Further extensions of the method and its implications are also discussed in the paper.", "year": "2003", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "citations": ["5390985d20f70186a0e07dc0", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2da07", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2da50", "53909f2c20f70186a0e37358", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a533", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40071", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4a63e", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c82d", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4cfa9", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4cfba", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4d3cb", "5390a30b20f70186a0e69b4c", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6d30f", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f0cb", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7e985", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82dc8", "5390a74f20f70186a0e8b761", "5390a8b220f70186a0e9c37a", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb13a6", "5390af8920f70186a0ecffee", "5390afc920f70186a0ed1509", "5390b29820f70186a0ee9738", "5390b29820f70186a0ee9713", "5390b36120f70186a0ef0edb", "5390b36120f70186a0ef101d", "5390b36120f70186a0ef13c3", "5390b36120f70186a0ef285a", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef40f5", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef435c", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef4bc1", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef676e", "5390b44620f70186a0ef9ad9", "5390b56a20f70186a0f04ec6", "5390b7fe20f70186a0f265a7", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2b151", "5390baa120f70186a0f389bd", "5390958a20f70186a0df05bf", "539095ba20f70186a0df0f84"], "references": ["539087be20f70186a0d51fe3", "539087c720f70186a0d56bdf", "539087d420f70186a0d5df23", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff6f", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff6d", "539087d920f70186a0d60e48", "539087dd20f70186a0d644cc", "539087dd20f70186a0d644ee", "539087e720f70186a0d6964e", "539087f320f70186a0d6f868", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fc4", "53908a5720f70186a0d9fff0", "53908a5720f70186a0da07ba", "53908a7420f70186a0da449a", "53908a9620f70186a0da4bb0", "53908a9620f70186a0da4cda", "53908a9620f70186a0da4d80", "53908a9620f70186a0da4d84", "53908a9620f70186a0da4e48", "53908a9620f70186a0da4d99"], "authors": ["Anthony K.

As a general data structure, graph can model complicated relations among data with wide applications in bioinformatics, Web exploration, and etc. However, mining large graph patterns in challenging due to the presence of an exponential number of frequent subgraphs. Instead of mining all the subgraphs, we propose to mine closed frequent graph patterns. A graph g is closed in a database if there exists no proper supergraph of g that has the same support as g. A closed graph pattern mining algorithm, CloseGraph, is developed by exploring several interesting pruning methods. Our performance study shows that CloseGraph not only dramatically reduces unnecessary subgraphs to be generated but also substantially increases the efficiency of mining, especially in the presence of large graph patterns.", "year": "2003", "venue": "Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390972920f70186a0dfaca3",

existing studies of text classification assume that the training data are completely labeled. In reality, however, many information retrieval problems can be more accurately described as learning a binary classifier from a set of incompletely labeled examples, where we typically have a small number of labeled positive examples and a very large number of unlabeled examples. In this paper, we study such a problem of performing Text Classification WithOut labeled Negative data TC-WON). In this paper, we explore an efficient extension of the standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, called SVMC (Support Vector Mapping Convergence) [17]for the TC-WON tasks. Our analyses show that when the positive training data is not too under-sampled, SVMC significantly outperforms other methods because SVMC basically exploits the natural \"gap\" between positive and negative documents in the feature space, which eventually corresponds to improving the generalization performance. In the text domain there are likely to exist many gaps in the feature space because a document is usually mapped to a sparse and high dimensional feature space. However, as the number of positive training data decreases, the boundary of SVMC starts overfitting at some point and end up generating very poor results.This is because when the positive training data is too few, the boundary over-iterates and trespasses the natural gaps between positive and negative class in the feature space and thus ends up fitting tightly around the few positive training data.", "year": "2003", "venue": "CIKM '03 Proceedings of the twelfth international conference on Information and knowledge management", "citations": ["539099a220f70186a0e17ef6", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2db54", "53909ed120f70186a0e30c00", "53909f8220f70186a0e3c536", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40240", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4edf9", "5390a17720f70186a0e52421", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d3ae", "5390a2e920f70186a0e686aa", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea7013", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebac37", "5390af8920f70186a0ed0f8d", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3f41", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef78e9", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f328af", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f4098a"], "references": ["5390994d20f70186a0e12f4d", "539099a220f70186a0e1775c", "539087aa20f70186a0d4bde7", "5390a6b120f70186a0e86002", "539087f820f70186a0d7136e", "5390880720f70186a0d78970", "5390881720f70186a0d7fe24", "5390881720f70186a0d7fe25", "5390881720f70186a0d80bfc", "5390882c20f70186a0d8d9cc", "53908a4020f70186a0d9f221", "53908a5720f70186a0da0a9c", "53908a5820f70186a0da10f2", "53908aac20f70186a0da84f4", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc3ea", "5390958920f70186a0dee9fe", "5390958920f70186a0dee9ff"], "authors": ["Hwanjo Yu", "ChengXiang Zhai", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a85ac60b4bee2dee413e"}}, {"index": "53908b6c20f70186a0dbd71c", "title": "Cancer classification using gene expression data", "abstract": "The classification of different tumor types is of great importance in cancer diagnosis and drug discovery. However, most previous cancer classification studies are clinical based and have limited diagnostic ability. Cancer classification using gene expression data is known to contain the keys for addressing the fundamental problems relating to cancer diagnosis and drug discovery. The recent advent of DNA microarray technique has made simultaneous monitoring of thousands of gene expressions possible. With this abundance of gene expression data, researchers have started to explore the possibilities of cancer classification using gene expression data. Quite a number of methods have been proposed in recent years with promising results. But there are still a lot of issues which need to be addressed and understood.In order to gain a deep insight into the cancer classification problem, it is necessary to take a closer look at the problem, the proposed solutions and the related issues all together. In this survey paper, we present a comprehensive overview of various proposed cancer classification methods and evaluate them based on their computation time, classification accuracy and ability to reveal biologically meaningful gene information. We also introduce and evaluate various proposed gene selection methods which we believe should be an integral preprocessing step for cancer classification. In order to obtain a full picture of cancer classification, we also discuss several issues related to cancer classification, including the biological significance vs. statistical significance of a cancer classifier, the asymmetrical classification errors for cancer classifiers, and the gene contamination problem.", "year": "2003", "venue": "Information Systems - Special issue: Data management

Virtually all existing solutions assume that the objects to be matched share the same attribute set and that systems can match them by comparing attribute similarities. Our work addresses the more general problem in which objects also have disjoint attributes-for example, matching tuples from relational tables that have different schemas, such as (age, name) and (name, salary). Profile-Based Object Matching, which applies this idea, exploits disjoint attributes to improve matching accuracy. PROM first matches any two tuples based on a shared attribute, such as name. It then applies a set of profilers, each of which contains some knowledge about what constitutes a typical person. The profilers examine the tuple pair to see if it plausibly describes a person. A profiler might state, for example, that if the pair produces a person with an age of 6 and a salary of $100,000, the pair doesn't describe a real person, so the tuples don't match. Profilers can be manually specified by domain experts, trained on training data, transferred from other matching tasks, or built from external data. PROM is thus distinct in that it not only exploits disjoint attributes to improve matching accuracy but also facilitates knowledge reuse from previous object-matching tasks.", "year": "2003", "venue": "IEEE Intelligent Systems", "citations": ["539098dc20f70186a0e0c65e", "539098dc20f70186a0e0c65f", "539098dc20f70186a0e0c662", "53909a9320f70186a0e22648", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2ed36", "53909ee020f70186a0e32414", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40d1e", "5390a17720f70186a0e51d81", "5390a1d420f70186a0e58d62", "5390a5b020f70186a0e7e002", "5390a5b020f70186a0e7e1d6", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7e69d", "5390a63c20f70186a0e834f5", "5390a74f20f70186a0e8d873", "5390a7f620f70186a0e94bd2", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3f27", "5390b2fc20f70186a0eef96f", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef7568", "558b1d1b612c41e6b9d43b24"], "references": ["5390985d20f70186a0e082f7", "539087d420f70186a0d5df1e", "539087e720f70186a0d6965e", "539087f320f70186a0d6ed95", "5390880720f70186a0d78771", "5390881220f70186a0d7e323", "53908a5820f70186a0da0f9a", "53908a9620f70186a0da4899", "53908a9720f70186a0da68e4", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc3ed", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc3f6", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc406", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a06", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a994", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a996", "5390aca920f70186a0eb98a7"], "authors": ["AnHai Doan", "Ying Lu", "Yoonkyong Lee", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a8a4c60b4bee2df23f79"}}, {"index": "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe2a", "title": "A framework for clustering evolving data streams", "abstract": "The clustering problem is a difficult problem for the data stream domain. This is because the large volumes of data arriving in a stream renders most traditional algorithms too inefficient. In recent years, a few one-pass clustering algorithms have been developed for the data stream problem. Although such methods address the scalability issues of the clustering problem, they are generally blind to the evolution of the data and do not address the following issues: (1) The quality of the clusters is poor when the data evolves considerably over time. (2) A data stream clustering algorithm requires much greater functionality in discovering and exploring clusters over different portions of the stream. The widely used practice of viewing data stream clustering algorithms as a class of one-pass clustering algorithms is not very useful from an application point of view. For example, a simple one-pass clustering algorithm over an entire data stream of a few years is dominated by the outdated history of the stream. The exploration of the stream over different time windows can provide the users with a much deeper understanding of the evolving behavior of the clusters. At the same time, it is not possible to simultaneously perform dynamic clustering over all possible time horizons for a data stream of even moderately large volume. This paper discusses a fundamentally different philosophy for data stream clustering which is guided by application-centered requirements. The idea is divide the clustering process into an online component which periodically stores detailed summary statistics and an offine component which uses only this summary statistics. The offine component is utilized by the analyst who can use a wide variety of inputs (such as time horizon or number of clusters) in order to provide a quick understanding of the broad clusters in the data stream. The problems of efficient choice, storage, and use of this statistical data for a fast data stream turns out to be quite tricky. For this purpose, we use the concepts of a pyramidal time frame in conjunction with a microclustering approach. Our performance experiments over a number of real and synthetic data sets illustrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and insights provided by our approach.", "year": "2003", "venue": "VLDB '03

Given a graph query, it is desirable to retrieve graphs quickly from a large database via graph-based indices. In this paper, we investigate the issues of indexing graphs and propose a novel solution by applying a graph mining technique. Different from the existing path-based methods, our approach, called gIndex, makes use of frequent substructure as the basic indexing feature. Frequent substructures are ideal candidates since they explore the intrinsic characteristics of the data and are relatively stable to database updates. To reduce the size of index structure, two techniques, size-increasing support constraint and discriminative fragments, are introduced. Our performance study shows that gIndex has 10 times smaller index size, but achieves 3--10 times better performance in comparison with a typical path-based method, GraphGrep. The gIndex approach not only provides and elegant solution to the graph indexing problem, but also demonstrates how database indexing and query processing can benefit form data mining, especially frequent pattern mining. Furthermore, the concepts developed here can be applied to indexing sequences, trees, and other complicated structures as well.", "year": "2004", "venue": "SIGMOD '04 Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data", "citations": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe42", "5390972920f70186a0dfbe21", "5390985d20f70186a0e06eba", "5390985d20f70186a0e06e87", "539098b820f70186a0e0a848", "539098b820f70186a0e0a852", "539098b820f70186a0e0a851", "5390990f20f70186a0e0ff89", "539099a220f70186a0e17fbb", "539099ec20f70186a0e1cb18", "53909a9320f70186a0e2202e", "53909ed120f70186a0e30f27", "53909ed120f70186a0e30eeb", "53909f2d20f70186a0e39532", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40247", "53909fbd20f70186a0e41c3f", "53909fbd20f70186a0e41c3e", "5390a01420f70186a0e47770", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4a79c", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c6ec", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c6ee", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d58b", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d64c", "5390a25820f70186a0e5e859", "5390a25820f70186a0e5f0ea", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6bc09", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6bc24", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6bc20", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6bc08", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f722", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f725", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e7502d", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7e982", "5390a63c20f70186a0e8324a", "5390a72220f70186a0e8963a", "5390a79f20f70186a0e922f3", "5390a79f20f70186a0e9232f", "5390a79f20f70186a0e9233b", "5390a96e20f70186a0ea2dc7", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea808f", "5390aa7620f70186a0eaa95b", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab831", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab873", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab870", "5390ac1820f70186a0eb3417", "5390aca920f70186a0eb951c", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebb88f", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebd0a6", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec52a8", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec5267", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec525d", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecab38", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecb126", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecb13a", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecbd62", "5390aefc20f70186a0ece0b8", "5390af8820f70186a0ececcf", "5390af8920f70186a0ed01d8", "5390afc920f70186a0ed2ccf", "5390afc920f70186a0ed352c", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed453e", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed4566", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed4baa", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5bab", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5be8", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5de5", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5eaf", "5390b04120f70186a0ed6f17", "5390b04120f70186a0ed8427", "5390b04120f70186a0ed842b", "5390b04120f70186a0ed8443", "5390b04120f70186a0ed85cc", "5390b0ca20f70186a0edac3c", "5390b13020f70186a0edd32f", "5390b13020f70186a0edd32e", "5390b13020f70186a0edd32d", "5390b13020f70186a0edd6ca", "5390b13020f70186a0edd71a", "5390b13020f70186a0eddd9d", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3fc9", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3fc6", "5390b24420f70186a0ee78e1", "5390b36120f70186a0ef0e54", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1456", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1f77", "5390b36120f70186a0ef260a", "5390b44620f70186a0ef810d", "5390b44620f70186a0ef94b9", "5390b48420f70186a0efc2f9", "5390b52620f70186a0f02e8e", "5390b56a20f70186a0f049fd", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0b995", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0ba99", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0baa7", "5390b5ed20f70186a0f0d969", "5390b5ed20f70186a0f0d94c", "5390b5ed20f70186a0f0e1bc", "5390b63320f70186a0f17d41", "5390b72d20f70186a0f202fc", "5390b72e20f70186a0f206a8", "5390b72e20f70186a0f2095e", "5390b72e20f70186a0f20965", "5390b78a20f70186a0f2312f", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a110", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a10f", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a267", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2c1fd", "5390b95420f70186a0f2dbab", "5390b95420f70186a0f2dbc5", "5390b95420f70186a0f2e268", "5390b9d520f70186a0f30a29", "5390b9d520f70186a0f30ea5", "5390b9d520f70186a0f32549", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f34d0e", "5390ba3820f70186a0f357d3", "5390ba3820f70186a0f36a07", "5390ba3820f70186a0f36f8b", "5390baa120f70186a0f37f23", "5390baa120f70186a0f383f8", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c289", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d0dc", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40bc5", "5390bd1520f70186a0f44166", "5390bda020f70186a0f45e16", "5390bded20f70186a0f482ce", "5390bded20f70186a0f485f8", "5390be6620f70186a0f4c37c", "5390bed320f70186a0f4e01e", "5390bf1320f70186a0f50446", "5390bf1320f70186a0f50686", "5390bf1320f70186a0f517b2", "5390bfa220f70186a0f535f3", "5390bfa220f70186a0f53710", "558c96af0cf22de7b05184eb", "558af767612c41e6b9d3ee8d", "558b7adf612c6b62e5e898ad", "558b335e612c41e6b9d46689", "558acbe5612c41e6b9d3a5cd", "558b821f612c6b62e5e8a486", "558b2fe0612c41e6b9d46172", "558ae500612c41e6b9d3cae1", "558b474d612c41e6b9d47f29", "558af661612c41e6b9d3eb99", "55323b8745cec66b6f9da13f", "55323b8845cec66b6f9da163", "55323bd445cec66b6f9daac6"], "references": ["5390881720f70186a0d80c62", "5390882420f70186a0d89094", "5390882d20f70186a0d8daac", "539089bb20f70186a0d98bb3", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa54", "53908a5820f70186a0da126f", "53908a7420f70186a0da4487", "53908a9620f70186a0da4936", "53908bde20f70186a0dc9458", "53908bde20f70186a0dc9483", "53908bde20f70186a0dc94c1", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a00", "53908d6620f70186a0dd2fac", "5390958a20f70186a0df05d9", "5390958a20f70186a0df05d5", "539095ba20f70186a0df0f89", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe75"], "authors": ["Xifeng Yan", "Philip S.

We first address several challenges in adopting SVM technology to the practice of data mining: (1)\u00a0scalability: SVMs are unscalable to data size while common data mining applications often involve millions or billions of data objects, (2)\u00a0applicability: SVMs are limited to (semi-) supervised learning which is mostly applied to binary classification problems, and (3)\u00a0interpretability: It is hard to interpret and extract knowledge from SVM models. We then propose three principled solutions, which address these challenges, for the problems of the large-scale classification, the single-class classification, and the discriminant feature combination discovery.

Such a database consists of multiple relations that are linked together conceptually via entity-relationship links in the design of relational database schemas. Multi-relational classification can be widely used in many disciplines including financial decision making and medical research. However, most classification approaches only work on single \u201cflat\u201d data relations. It is usually difficult to convert multiple relations into a single flat relation without either introducing huge \u201cuniversal relation\u201d or losing essential information. Previous works using Inductive Logic Programming approaches (recently also known as Relational Mining) have proven effective with high accuracy in multi-relational classification. Unfortunately, they fail to achieve high scalability w.r.t. the number of relations in databases because they repeatedly join different relations to search for good literals. In this paper we propose CrossMine, an efficient and scalable approach for multi-relational classification. CrossMine employs tuple ID propagation, a novel method for virtually joining relations, which enables flexible and efficient search among multiple relations. CrossMine also uses aggregated information to provide essential statistics for classification. A selective sampling method is used to achieve high scalability w.r.t. the number of tuples in the databases.

There are three majorapproaches developed in this direction: (1) top-downcomputation, represented by MultiWay array aggregation[An Array-Based Algorithm for Simultaneous Multidimensional Aggregates], which utilizes shared computation and performs wellon dense data sets; (2) bottom-up computation, representedby BUC [Bottom-up computation of sparse and iceberg cubes], which takes advantage of Apriori Pruning and performs well on sparse data sets; and (3) integratedtop-down and bottom-up computation, represented by Star-Cubing[Computing Iceberg Cubes by Top-Down and Bottom-Up Integration], which takes advantages of both and has high performance in most cases. However, the performance ofStar-Cubing degrades in very sparse data sets due to theadditional cost introduced by the tree structure. None of thethree approaches achieves uniformly high performance onall kinds of data sets.In this paper, we present a new approach that computeIceberg Cubes by factorizing the lattice space accordingto the frequency of values. This approach, different fromall the previous dimension-based approaches where the importanceof data distribution is not recognized, partitionsthe cube lattice into one dense subspace and several sparsesubspaces. With this approach, a new method called MM-Cubinghas been developed. MM-Cubing is highly adaptiveto dense, sparse or skewed data sets.

While complex matchings are common, because of their far more complex search space, most existing techniques focus on simple 1:1 matchings. To tackle this challenge, this paper takes a conceptually novel approach by viewing schema matching as correlation mining, for our task of matching Web query interfaces to integrate the myriad databases on the Internet. On this \"deep Web,\" query interfaces generally form complex matchings between attribute groups (e.g., [author] corresponds to [first name, last name] in the Books domain). We observe that the co-occurrences patterns across query interfaces often reveal such complex semantic relationships: grouping attributes (e.g., [first name, last name]) tend to be co-present in query interfaces and thus positively correlated. In contrast, synonym attributes are negatively correlated because they rarely co-occur. This insight enables us to discover complex matchings by a correlation mining approach. In particular, we develop the DCM framework, which consists of data preparation, dual mining of positive and negative correlations, and finally matching selection. Unlike previous correlation mining algorithms, which mainly focus on finding strong positive correlations, our algorithm cares both positive and negative correlations, especially the subtlety of negative correlations, due to its special importance in schema matching. This leads to the introduction of a new correlation measure, $H$-measure, distinct from those proposed in previous work. We evaluate our approach extensively and the results show good accuracy for discovering complex matchings.", "year": "2004", "venue": "Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390979920f70186a0dffa4b", "5390979920f70186a0dffb8a", "5390980720f70186a0e01e35", "5390980720f70186a0e02c84", "5390980720f70186a0e02c8c", "5390981d20f70186a0e04579", "5390981d20f70186a0e05a1f", "5390985d20f70186a0e06ead", "539098b820f70186a0e0ad68", "539098dc20f70186a0e0c662", "539098dc20f70186a0e0dc18", "5390995d20f70186a0e15c6f", "539099b320f70186a0e1b7ea", "539099ec20f70186a0e1cb3a", "53909a0220f70186a0e1f2c0", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4a7c4", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e543b5", "5390a1d420f70186a0e569c5", "5390a1d420f70186a0e574df", "5390a1d420f70186a0e584fb", "5390a28020f70186a0e62ede", "5390a55520f70186a0e795e0", "5390a74f20f70186a0e8b746", "5390a74f20f70186a0e8c60b", "5390a79f20f70186a0e9230c", "5390a7f520f70186a0e93b01", "5390a80f20f70186a0e96824", "5390aa0f20f70186a0ea8f49", "5390aa7620f70186a0eaa3e8", "5390ac5720f70186a0eb6129", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecaca3", "5390af8920f70186a0ecfc5c", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed4521", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5a2c", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5a2a", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3ef9", "5390b2fc20f70186a0eef949", "5390b2fc20f70186a0eef94a", "5390b44620f70186a0efa183", "5390b4c420f70186a0efea4e", "5390b72d20f70186a0f202eb", "5390b86b20f70186a0f29e6f", "5390b86b20f70186a0f29e6d", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f32ec5", "55323b8f45cec66b6f9da278"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfac90", "5390878320f70186a0d32421", "539087be20f70186a0d51fe3", "539087dd20f70186a0d644cc", "5390881220f70186a0d7e323", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2e9", "53908a4020f70186a0d9dc84", "53908a9620f70186a0da492b", "53908b4920f70186a0dbb0b1", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc3d5", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a07", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a0f", "5390958a20f70186a0defdc0", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef5e26"], "authors": ["Bin He", "Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a599c60b4bede9eb8b87"}}, {"index": "5390972920f70186a0dfb178", "title": "Mining Constrained Gradients in Large Databases", "abstract": "Many data analysis tasks can be viewed as search or mining in a multidimensional space (MDS). In such MDSs, dimensions capture potentially important factors for given applications, and cells represent combinations of values for the factors. To systematically analyze data in MDS, an interesting notion, called \"cubegrade\u9a74 was recently introduced by Imielinski et al. [CHECK END OF SENTENCE], which focuses on the notable changes in measures in MDS by comparing a cell (which we refer to as probe cell) with its gradient cells, namely, its ancestors, descendants, and siblings. We call such queries gradient analysis queries (GQs). Since an MDS can contain billions of cells, it is important to answer GQs efficiently. In this study, we focus on developing efficient methods for mining GQs constrained by certain (weakly) antimonotone constraints. Instead of conducting an independent gradient-cell search once per probe cell, which is inefficient due to much repeated work, we propose an efficient algorithm, LiveSet-Driven. This algorithm finds all good gradient-probe cell pairs in one search pass. It utilizes measure-value analysis and dimension-match analysis in a set-oriented manner, to achieve bidirectional pruning between the sets of hopeful probe cells and of hopeful gradient cells. Moreover, it adopts a hypertree structure and an H-cubing method to compress data and to maximize sharing of computation. Our performance study shows that this algorithm is efficient and scalable. In addition to data cubes, we extend our study to another important scenario: mining constrained gradients in transactional databases where each item is associated with some measures such as price. Such transactional databases can be viewed as sparse MDSs where items represent dimensions, although they have significantly different characteristics than data cubes.

Given a graph query, it is desirable to retrieve graphs quickly from a large database via graph-based indices. In this paper, we investigate the issues of indexing graphs and propose a novel solution by applying a graph mining technique. Different from the existing path-based methods, our approach, called gIndex, makes use of frequent substructure as the basic indexing feature. Frequent substructures are ideal candidates since they explore the intrinsic characteristics of the data and are relatively stable to database updates. To reduce the size of index structure, two techniques, size-increasing support constraint and discriminative fragments, are introduced. Our performance study shows that gIndex has 10 times smaller index size, but achieves 3--10 times better performance in comparison with a typical path-based method, GraphGrep. The gIndex approach not only provides and elegant solution to the graph indexing problem, but also demonstrates how database indexing and query processing can benefit form data mining, especially frequent pattern mining. Furthermore, the concepts developed here can be applied to indexing sequences, trees, and other complicated structures as well.", "year": "2004", "venue": "SIGMOD '04 Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data", "citations": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe42", "5390972920f70186a0dfbe21", "5390985d20f70186a0e06eba", "5390985d20f70186a0e06e87", "539098b820f70186a0e0a848", "539098b820f70186a0e0a852", "539098b820f70186a0e0a851", "5390990f20f70186a0e0ff89", "539099a220f70186a0e17fbb", "539099ec20f70186a0e1cb18", "53909a9320f70186a0e2202e", "53909ed120f70186a0e30f27", "53909ed120f70186a0e30eeb", "53909f2d20f70186a0e39532", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40247", "53909fbd20f70186a0e41c3f", "53909fbd20f70186a0e41c3e", "5390a01420f70186a0e47770", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4a79c", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c6ec", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c6ee", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d58b", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d64c", "5390a25820f70186a0e5e859", "5390a25820f70186a0e5f0ea", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6bc09", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6bc24", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6bc20", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6bc08", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f722", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f725", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e7502d", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7e982", "5390a63c20f70186a0e8324a", "5390a72220f70186a0e8963a", "5390a79f20f70186a0e922f3", "5390a79f20f70186a0e9232f", "5390a79f20f70186a0e9233b", "5390a96e20f70186a0ea2dc7", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea808f", "5390aa7620f70186a0eaa95b", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab831", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab873", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab870", "5390ac1820f70186a0eb3417", "5390aca920f70186a0eb951c", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebb88f", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebd0a6", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec52a8", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec5267", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec525d", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecab38", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecb126", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecb13a", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecbd62", "5390aefc20f70186a0ece0b8", "5390af8820f70186a0ececcf", "5390af8920f70186a0ed01d8", "5390afc920f70186a0ed2ccf", "5390afc920f70186a0ed352c", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed453e", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed4566", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed4baa", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5bab", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5be8", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5de5", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5eaf", "5390b04120f70186a0ed6f17", "5390b04120f70186a0ed8427", "5390b04120f70186a0ed842b", "5390b04120f70186a0ed8443", "5390b04120f70186a0ed85cc", "5390b0ca20f70186a0edac3c", "5390b13020f70186a0edd32f", "5390b13020f70186a0edd32e", "5390b13020f70186a0edd32d", "5390b13020f70186a0edd6ca", "5390b13020f70186a0edd71a", "5390b13020f70186a0eddd9d", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3fc9", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3fc6", "5390b24420f70186a0ee78e1", "5390b36120f70186a0ef0e54", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1456", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1f77", "5390b36120f70186a0ef260a", "5390b44620f70186a0ef810d", "5390b44620f70186a0ef94b9", "5390b48420f70186a0efc2f9", "5390b52620f70186a0f02e8e", "5390b56a20f70186a0f049fd", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0b995", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0ba99", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0baa7", "5390b5ed20f70186a0f0d969", "5390b5ed20f70186a0f0d94c", "5390b5ed20f70186a0f0e1bc", "5390b63320f70186a0f17d41", "5390b72d20f70186a0f202fc", "5390b72e20f70186a0f206a8", "5390b72e20f70186a0f2095e", "5390b72e20f70186a0f20965", "5390b78a20f70186a0f2312f", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a110", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a10f", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a267", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2c1fd", "5390b95420f70186a0f2dbab", "5390b95420f70186a0f2dbc5", "5390b95420f70186a0f2e268", "5390b9d520f70186a0f30a29", "5390b9d520f70186a0f30ea5", "5390b9d520f70186a0f32549", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f34d0e", "5390ba3820f70186a0f357d3", "5390ba3820f70186a0f36a07", "5390ba3820f70186a0f36f8b", "5390baa120f70186a0f37f23", "5390baa120f70186a0f383f8", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c289", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d0dc", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40bc5", "5390bd1520f70186a0f44166", "5390bda020f70186a0f45e16", "5390bded20f70186a0f482ce", "5390bded20f70186a0f485f8", "5390be6620f70186a0f4c37c", "5390bed320f70186a0f4e01e", "5390bf1320f70186a0f50446", "5390bf1320f70186a0f50686", "5390bf1320f70186a0f517b2", "5390bfa220f70186a0f535f3", "5390bfa220f70186a0f53710", "558c96af0cf22de7b05184eb", "558af767612c41e6b9d3ee8d", "558b7adf612c6b62e5e898ad", "558b335e612c41e6b9d46689", "558acbe5612c41e6b9d3a5cd", "558b821f612c6b62e5e8a486", "558b2fe0612c41e6b9d46172", "558ae500612c41e6b9d3cae1", "558b474d612c41e6b9d47f29", "558af661612c41e6b9d3eb99", "55323b8745cec66b6f9da13f", "55323b8845cec66b6f9da163", "55323bd445cec66b6f9daac6"], "references": ["5390881720f70186a0d80c62", "5390882420f70186a0d89094", "5390882d20f70186a0d8daac", "539089bb20f70186a0d98bb3", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa54", "53908a5820f70186a0da126f", "53908a7420f70186a0da4487", "53908a9620f70186a0da4936", "53908bde20f70186a0dc9458", "53908bde20f70186a0dc9483", "53908bde20f70186a0dc94c1", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a00", "53908d6620f70186a0dd2fac", "5390958a20f70186a0df05d9", "5390958a20f70186a0df05d5", "539095ba20f70186a0df0f89", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe75"], "authors": ["Xifeng Yan", "Philip S.

Such a database consists of multiple relations that are linked together conceptually via entity-relationship links in the design of relational database schemas. Multi-relational classification can be widely used in many disciplines including financial decision making and medical research. However, most classification approaches only work on single \u201cflat\u201d data relations. It is usually difficult to convert multiple relations into a single flat relation without either introducing huge \u201cuniversal relation\u201d or losing essential information. Previous works using Inductive Logic Programming approaches (recently also known as Relational Mining) have proven effective with high accuracy in multi-relational classification. Unfortunately, they fail to achieve high scalability w.r.t. the number of relations in databases because they repeatedly join different relations to search for good literals. In this paper we propose CrossMine, an efficient and scalable approach for multi-relational classification. CrossMine employs tuple ID propagation, a novel method for virtually joining relations, which enables flexible and efficient search among multiple relations. CrossMine also uses aggregated information to provide essential statistics for classification. A selective sampling method is used to achieve high scalability w.r.t. the number of tuples in the databases. Our comprehensive experiments on both real and synthetic databases demonstrate the high scalability and accuracy of CrossMine.", "year": "2004", "venue": "Proceedings of the 2004 European conference on Constraint-Based Mining and Inductive Databases", "citations": ["5390af8920f70186a0ecf8ee", "5390b1d220f70186a0ee11a2"], "references": ["5390879d20f70186a0d44ec1", "539087ae20f70186a0d4df1b", "5390a6b120f70186a0e84363", "5390a6d920f70186a0e8878e", "5390882420f70186a0d88847", "5390882c20f70186a0d8cd30", "5390882c20f70186a0d8d572", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fde", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fd2", "53908a4020f70186a0d9f1a7", "53908a5820f70186a0da1034", "53908a7420f70186a0da45c9", "5390958a20f70186a0df0601"], "authors": ["Xiaoxin Yin", "Jiawei Han", "Jiong Yang", "Philip S.

This approach, different fromall the previous dimension-based approaches where the importanceof data distribution is not recognized, partitionsthe cube lattice into one dense subspace and several sparsesubspaces.

While complex matchings are common, because of their far more complex search space, most existing techniques focus on simple 1:1 matchings. To tackle this challenge, this paper takes a conceptually novel approach by viewing schema matching as correlation mining, for our task of matching Web query interfaces to integrate the myriad databases on the Internet. On this \"deep Web,\" query interfaces generally form complex matchings between attribute groups (e.g., [author] corresponds to [first name, last name] in the Books domain). We observe that the co-occurrences patterns across query interfaces often reveal such complex semantic relationships: grouping attributes (e.g., [first name, last name]) tend to be co-present in query interfaces and thus positively correlated. In contrast, synonym attributes are negatively correlated because they rarely co-occur. This insight enables us to discover complex matchings by a correlation mining approach. In particular, we develop the DCM framework, which consists of data preparation, dual mining of positive and negative correlations, and finally matching selection. Unlike previous correlation mining algorithms, which mainly focus on finding strong positive correlations, our algorithm cares both positive and negative correlations, especially the subtlety of negative correlations, due to its special importance in schema matching. This leads to the introduction of a new correlation measure, $H$-measure, distinct from those proposed in previous work. We evaluate our approach extensively and the results show good accuracy for discovering complex matchings.", "year": "2004", "venue": "Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390979920f70186a0dffa4b", "5390979920f70186a0dffb8a", "5390980720f70186a0e01e35", "5390980720f70186a0e02c84", "5390980720f70186a0e02c8c", "5390981d20f70186a0e04579", "5390981d20f70186a0e05a1f", "5390985d20f70186a0e06ead", "539098b820f70186a0e0ad68", "539098dc20f70186a0e0c662", "539098dc20f70186a0e0dc18", "5390995d20f70186a0e15c6f", "539099b320f70186a0e1b7ea", "539099ec20f70186a0e1cb3a", "53909a0220f70186a0e1f2c0", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4a7c4", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e543b5", "5390a1d420f70186a0e569c5", "5390a1d420f70186a0e574df", "5390a1d420f70186a0e584fb", "5390a28020f70186a0e62ede", "5390a55520f70186a0e795e0", "5390a74f20f70186a0e8b746", "5390a74f20f70186a0e8c60b", "5390a79f20f70186a0e9230c", "5390a7f520f70186a0e93b01", "5390a80f20f70186a0e96824", "5390aa0f20f70186a0ea8f49", "5390aa7620f70186a0eaa3e8", "5390ac5720f70186a0eb6129", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecaca3", "5390af8920f70186a0ecfc5c", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed4521", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5a2c", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5a2a", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3ef9", "5390b2fc20f70186a0eef949", "5390b2fc20f70186a0eef94a", "5390b44620f70186a0efa183", "5390b4c420f70186a0efea4e", "5390b72d20f70186a0f202eb", "5390b86b20f70186a0f29e6f", "5390b86b20f70186a0f29e6d", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f32ec5", "55323b8f45cec66b6f9da278"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfac90", "5390878320f70186a0d32421", "539087be20f70186a0d51fe3", "539087dd20f70186a0d644cc", "5390881220f70186a0d7e323", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2e9", "53908a4020f70186a0d9dc84", "53908a9620f70186a0da492b", "53908b4920f70186a0dbb0b1", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc3d5", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a07", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a0f", "5390958a20f70186a0defdc0", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef5e26"], "authors": ["Bin He", "Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a666c60b4bee2dd6e39a"}}, {"index": "5390972920f70186a0dfb178", "title": "Mining Constrained Gradients in Large Databases", "abstract": "Many data analysis tasks can be viewed as search or mining in a multidimensional space (MDS). In such MDSs, dimensions capture potentially important factors for given applications, and cells represent combinations of values for the factors. To systematically analyze data in MDS, an interesting notion, called \"cubegrade\u9a74 was recently introduced by Imielinski et al. [CHECK END OF SENTENCE], which focuses on the notable changes in measures in MDS by comparing a cell (which we refer to as probe cell) with its gradient cells, namely, its ancestors, descendants, and siblings. We call such queries gradient analysis queries (GQs). Since an MDS can contain billions of cells, it is important to answer GQs efficiently. In this study, we focus on developing efficient methods for mining GQs constrained by certain (weakly) antimonotone constraints. Instead of conducting an independent gradient-cell search once per probe cell, which is inefficient due to much repeated work, we propose an efficient algorithm, LiveSet-Driven. This algorithm finds all good gradient-probe cell pairs in one search pass. It utilizes measure-value analysis and dimension-match analysis in a set-oriented manner, to achieve bidirectional pruning between the sets of hopeful probe cells and of hopeful gradient cells. Moreover, it adopts a hypertree structure and an H-cubing method to compress data and to maximize sharing of computation. Our performance study shows that this algorithm is efficient and scalable. In addition to data cubes, we extend our study to another important scenario: mining constrained gradients in transactional databases where each item is associated with some measures such as price. Such transactional databases can be viewed as sparse MDSs where items represent dimensions, although they have significantly different characteristics than data cubes.

The nature of stream data makes it essential to use algorithms which require only one pass over the data. Recently, single-scan, stream analysis methods have been proposed in this context. However, a lot of stream data is high-dimensional in nature. High-dimensional data is inherently more complex in clustering, classification, and similarity search. Recent research discusses methods for projected clustering over high-dimensional data sets. This method is however difficult to generalize to data streams because of the complexity of the method and the large volume of the data streams. In this paper, we propose a new, high-dimensional, projected data stream clustering method, called HPStream. The method incorporates a fading cluster structure, and the projection based clustering methodology. It is incrementally updatable and is highly scalable on both the number of dimensions and the size of the data streams, and it achieves better clustering quality in comparison with the previous stream clustering methods. Our performance study with both real and synthetic data sets demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed framework and implementation methods.", "year": "2004", "venue": "VLDB '04 Proceedings of the Thirtieth international conference on Very large data bases - Volume 30", "citations": ["5390981d20f70186a0e043c7", "539098b820f70186a0e0adf0", "539098dd20f70186a0e0e589", "5390990f20f70186a0e106cb", "5390994d20f70186a0e13216", "539099b320f70186a0e1b7d8", "539099ec20f70186a0e1cb34", "53909a0320f70186a0e20449", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2f00d", "53909ee020f70186a0e31e53", "53909fbd20f70186a0e41c55", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4a75d", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e566a3", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e566bb", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e566d1", "5390a1d420f70186a0e58bc4", "5390a25820f70186a0e5fddc", "5390a2be20f70186a0e65029", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6c24b", "5390a40520f70186a0e6eebd", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f791", "5390a40520f70186a0e6fecb", "5390a40520f70186a0e704f2", "5390a45520f70186a0e717ac", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e745a0", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75104", "5390a63c20f70186a0e8158e", "5390a63c20f70186a0e81f51", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82cd4", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82cd6", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82e7e", "5390a6d920f70186a0e864c2", "5390a74f20f70186a0e8d872", "5390a8dc20f70186a0e9f230", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea0c6b", "5390a96f20f70186a0ea41dd", "5390a96f20f70186a0ea44ae", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea7878", "5390aa0f20f70186a0ea8f08", "5390aa7620f70186a0eaa3bf", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb1500", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb19aa", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebbf9f", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebed34", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec5855", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec6820", "5390af8920f70186a0ecfcee", "5390b0ca20f70186a0edb12d", "5390b13020f70186a0edd333", "5390b19020f70186a0edfb7d", "5390b1d220f70186a0ee15a8", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3f62", "5390b29820f70186a0eeae9f", "5390b2d720f70186a0eed292", "5390b2fc20f70186a0eeebbb", "5390b36120f70186a0ef0edf", "5390b36120f70186a0ef13fd", "5390b36120f70186a0ef2085", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef41c0", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef44b0", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef51f8", "5390b44620f70186a0ef97cf", "5390b48420f70186a0efb642", "5390b4c320f70186a0efdc01", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0ba14", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0ba15", "5390b64020f70186a0f1900a", "5390b71120f70186a0f1ec94", "5390b72e20f70186a0f22045", "5390b86b20f70186a0f29e58", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2b589", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2bff8", "5390b9d520f70186a0f312f7", "5390b9d520f70186a0f3151b", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c2d7", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d310", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f4193c", "5390bda020f70186a0f45963", "5390be6620f70186a0f4c7e9", "5390be6620f70186a0f4d1f7", "5390bed320f70186a0f4e64b", "5390bfa220f70186a0f542ae", "5390bfa220f70186a0f542f1", "5390bfa220f70186a0f54773", "558b79bf612c6b62e5e8973e", "558af08e612c41e6b9d3dfdf", "558b24c2612c41e6b9d44b1a", "558ca0140cf2a5d42f125a05", "558b37b8612c41e6b9d46e42", "55323bc045cec66b6f9da83e"], "references": ["53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe2a", "5390878720f70186a0d359bd", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff7a", "539087e720f70186a0d69653", "539087e720f70186a0d69655", "539087f320f70186a0d6f85f", "539087f320f70186a0d6f860", "5390880220f70186a0d76901", "5390880720f70186a0d78755", "5390880720f70186a0d78761", "5390880d20f70186a0d7b02b", "5390882420f70186a0d89091", "53908a9620f70186a0da4ba7", "53908b9320f70186a0dc07d2", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a25", "53908d6620f70186a0dd2f90", "53908d6620f70186a0dd2f73", "5390962020f70186a0df3a45"], "authors": ["Charu C.

Most of the previous studies adopt an Apriori-like candidate set generation-and-test approach. However, candidate set generation is still costly, especially when there exist a large number of patterns and/or long patterns.In this study, we propose a novel frequent-pattern tree (FP-tree) structure, which is an extended prefix-tree structure for storing compressed, crucial information about frequent patterns, and develop an efficient FP-tree-based mining method, FP-growth, for mining the complete set of frequent patterns by pattern fragment growth. Efficiency of mining is achieved with three techniques: (1) a large database is compressed into a condensed, smaller data structure, FP-tree which avoids costly, repeated database scans, (2) our FP-tree-based mining adopts a pattern-fragment growth method to avoid the costly generation of a large number of candidate sets, and (3) a partitioning-based, divide-and-conquer method is used to decompose the mining task into a set of smaller tasks for mining confined patterns in conditional databases, which dramatically reduces the search space. Our performance study shows that the FP-growth method is efficient and scalable for mining both long and short frequent patterns, and is about an order of magnitude faster than the Apriori algorithm and also faster than some recently reported new frequent-pattern mining methods.", "year": "2004", "venue": "Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery", "citations": ["5390972920f70186a0dfacc5",

However, frequent-pattern mining often generates too many patterns to be truly efficient or effective. In many applications, it is sufficient to generate and examine frequent patterns with a sufficiently good approximation of the support frequency instead of in full precision. Such a compact but \"close-enough\" frequent-pattern base is called a condensed frequent-pattern base.In this paper, we propose and examine several alternatives for the design, representation, and implementation of such condensed frequent-pattern bases. Several algorithms for computing such pattern bases are proposed. Their effectiveness at pattern compression and methods for efficiently computing them are investigated. A systematic performance study is conducted on different kinds of databases, and demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in handling frequent-pattern mining in large databases.", "year": "2004", "venue": "Knowledge and Information Systems", "citations": ["53909e8b20f70186a0e2da1e", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2ea31", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a080", "5390a0b720f70186a0e50042", "5390a17720f70186a0e52465", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d515", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7e985", "5390a74f20f70186a0e8c0bf", "5390aaf920f70186a0eada71", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed58fb", "5390b29820f70186a0eeaea5", "5390b29820f70186a0eeb03b", "5390b2d720f70186a0eec431", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0a5ba", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e258", "5390bfa220f70186a0f542b5"], "references": ["539087dd20f70186a0d644cc", "539087e720f70186a0d6964e", "539087e720f70186a0d69654", "539087f320f70186a0d6f879", "539087f320f70186a0d6f868", "539087f820f70186a0d711d6", "5390880220f70186a0d75ed5", "5390880720f70186a0d7875b", "5390880d20f70186a0d7d1fb", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fc4", "539089ab20f70186a0d95012", "53908a5720f70186a0d9fff0", "53908a5720f70186a0da07ba", "53908a5720f70186a0da0bff", "53908a5720f70186a0da0c06", "53908a5720f70186a0da0bf8", "53908a5820f70186a0da11ce", "53908a5820f70186a0da1283", "53908a7420f70186a0da449a", "53908a9620f70186a0da491c", "53908a9620f70186a0da4bb0", "53908b2a20f70186a0db9753", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc400", "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9de2"], "authors": ["Jian Pei", "Guozhu Dong", "Wei Zou", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a745c60b4bee2de12e7a"}}, {"index": "53909f8c20f70186a0e401ba", "title": "High-dimensional OLAP: a minimal cubing approach", "abstract": "Data cube has been playing an essential role in fast OLAP (online analytical processing) in many multi-dimensional data warehouses. However, there exist data sets in applications like bioinformatics, statistics, and text processing that are characterized by high dimensionality, e.g., over 100 dimensions, and moderate size, e.g., around 106 tuples. No feasible data cube can be constructed with such data sets. In this paper we will address the problem of developing an efficient algorithm to perform OLAP on such data sets. Experience tells us that although data analysis tasks may involve a high dimensional space, most OLAP operations are performed only on a small number of dimensions at a time. Based on this observation, we propose a novel method that computes a thin layer of the data cube together with associated value-list indices. This layer, while being manageable in size, will be capable of supporting flexible and fast OLAP operations in the original high dimensional space. Through experiments we will show that the method has I/O costs that scale nicely with dimensionality.

However, it is also a difficult problem since the mining may have to generate or examine a combinatorially explosive number of intermediate subsequences. Most of the previously developed sequential pattern mining methods, such as GSP, explore a candidate generation-and-test approach [1] to reduce the number of candidates to be examined. However, this approach may not be efficient in mining large sequence databases having numerous patterns and/or long patterns. In this paper, we propose a projection-based, sequential pattern-growth approach for efficient mining of sequential patterns. In this approach, a sequence database is recursively projected into a set of smaller projected databases, and sequential patterns are grown in each projected database by exploring only locally frequent fragments. Based on an initial study of the pattern growth-based sequential pattern mining, FreeSpan [8], we propose a more efficient method, called PSP, which offers ordered growth and reduced projected databases. To further improve the performance, a pseudoprojection technique is developed in PrefixSpan. A comprehensive performance study shows that PrefixSpan, in most cases, outperforms the a priori-based algorithm GSP, FreeSpan, and SPADE [29] (a sequential pattern mining algorithm that adopts vertical data format), and PrefixSpan integrated with pseudoprojection is the fastest among all the tested algorithms. Furthermore, this mining methodology can be extended to mining sequential patterns with user-specified constraints. The high promise of the pattern-growth approach may lead to its further extension toward efficient mining of other kinds of frequent patterns, such as frequent substructures.", "year": "2004",

However, such work gives users only thin skylines, i.e., single objects, which may not be desirable in some real applications. In this paper, we propose a novel concept, called thick skyline, which recommends not only skyline objects but also their nearby neighbors within -distance. Efficient computation methods are developed including (1) two efficient algorithms, Sampling-and-Pruning and Indexing-and-Estimating, to find such thick skyline with the help of statistics or indexes in large databases, and (2) a highly efficient Microcluster-based algorithm for mining thick skyline. The Microcluster-based method not only leads to substantial savings in computation but also provides a cocise representation of the thick skyline in the case of high cardinalities. Our experimental performance study shows that the proposed methods are both efficient and effective.", "year": "2004", "venue": "PKDD '04 Proceedings of the 8th European Conference on Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases", "citations": ["539098b820f70186a0e0ad74", "539099a220f70186a0e18028", "53909a0220f70186a0e1f2c4", "53909a0320f70186a0e20468", "5390a05920f70186a0e49bb0", "5390a2be20f70186a0e64350", "5390a63c20f70186a0e827f3", "5390a77d20f70186a0e8dd1c", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea622d", "5390b2d720f70186a0eebfa1", "5390b4c420f70186a0efeb72", "5390b5ed20f70186a0f0d330", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e01c", "5390b86b20f70186a0f291c9", "5390b9d520f70186a0f306e9", "5390ba3820f70186a0f357e3", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40c41", "558b28c3612c41e6b9d451ed", "558b5202612c41e6b9d4922d"], "references": [], "authors": ["Wen Jin", "Jiawei Han", "Martin Ester"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a7dbc60b4bee2de7b59f"}}, {"index": "5390958a20f70186a0df0498", "title": "PEBL: Web Page Classification without Negative Examples", "abstract": "Abstract--Web page classification is one of the essential techniques for Web mining because classifying Web pages of an interesting class is often the first step of mining the Web. However, constructing a classifier for an interesting class requires laborious pre-processing such as collecting positive and negative training examples. For instance, in order to construct a \u9a74homepage\u9a74 classifier, one needs to collect a sample of homepages (positive examples) and a sample of nonhomepages (negative examples). In particular, collecting negative training examples requires arduous work and caution to avoid bias. This paper presents a framework, called Positive Example Based Learning (PEBL), for Web page classification which eliminates the need for manually collecting negative training examples in preprocessing. The PEBL framework applies an algorithm, called Mapping-Convergence (M-C), to achieve high classification accuracy (with positive and unlabeled data) as high as that of a traditional SVM (with positive and negative data). M-C runs in two stages: the mapping stage and convergence stage. In the mapping stage, the algorithm uses a weak classifier that draws an initial approximation of \u9a74strong\u9a74 negative data. Based on the initial approximation, the convergence stage iteratively runs an internal classifier (e.g., SVM) which maximizes margins to progressively improve the approximation of negative data. Thus, the class boundary eventually converges to the true boundary of the positive class in the feature space. We present the M-C algorithm with supporting theoretical and experimental justifications. Our experiments show that, given the same set of positive examples, the M-C algorithm outperforms one-class SVMs, and it is almost as accurate as the traditional SVMs.", "year": "2004", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "citations": ["5390990f20f70186a0e0fdab", "539099a220f70186a0e18f79", "53909a0320f70186a0e20454", "53909ed120f70186a0e3140f", "5390a01420f70186a0e46662", "5390a01420f70186a0e469ac", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4cff7", "5390a17720f70186a0e52428", "5390a1d420f70186a0e58101", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5cdb0", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5cfc3", "5390a25820f70186a0e5ec39", "5390a2be20f70186a0e64e3a", "5390a2e920f70186a0e686aa", "5390a40520f70186a0e6fc74", "5390a40520f70186a0e6fca1", "5390a45520f70186a0e71251", "5390a54620f70186a0e77955", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7f65a", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82843", "5390a6d920f70186a0e86615", "5390a72220f70186a0e896ee", "5390a8b220f70186a0e9cd86", "5390a96e20f70186a0ea2dd2", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea5a06", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea77c4", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb1bf1", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebbf55", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec73a4", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec8f3e", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecb3b3", "5390b0ca20f70186a0ed9f51", "5390b13020f70186a0edd216", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3f41", "5390b2fc20f70186a0eeda3e", "5390b44620f70186a0ef8a51", "5390b48420f70186a0efbc96", "5390b4c320f70186a0efd4e1", "5390b5c620f70186a0f07c23", "5390b5fa20f70186a0f10908", "5390b60d20f70186a0f127db", "5390b68720f70186a0f1bde7", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f328af", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f32f0d", "5390baa120f70186a0f38af1", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c53e", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d365", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f4098a", "5390bd1520f70186a0f43f31", "5390be6620f70186a0f4c2a3", "5390be6620f70186a0f4d201", "5390bed320f70186a0f4e42b", "5390bf1320f70186a0f514ae", "5390bfa220f70186a0f53516", "5390bfa220f70186a0f537a7", "558bd0460cf20e727d0f2086", "558bd1a80cf20e727d0f22d1", "558b0d16612c41e6b9d418c4", "5390958a20f70186a0defd98"], "references": ["539087cf20f70186a0d5cd8f", "539087d420f70186a0d5f577", "5390b68720f70186a0f1ae11", "539087ef20f70186a0d6da64", "539087f820f70186a0d7136e", "5390880220f70186a0d767c3", "5390880220f70186a0d78212", "5390880220f70186a0d78213", "5390880720f70186a0d78799", "5390880720f70186a0d78970", "5390880720f70186a0d79ef2", "53908a4020f70186a0d9f221", "53908a5720f70186a0da0a9c", "53908a5820f70186a0da10f2", "53908af920f70186a0db003f", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc3ea", "53908bcc20f70186a0dc5df3", "5390958920f70186a0dee9fe", "5390958920f70186a0dee9ff", "5390958920f70186a0dee9c7"], "authors": ["Hwanjo Yu", "Jiawei Han", "Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a7fcc60b4bee2de973d7"}}, {"index": "5390972920f70186a0dfbe35", "title": "On demand classification of data streams", "abstract": "Current models of the classification problem do not effectively handle bursts of particular classes coming in at different times. In fact, the current model of the classification problem simply concentrates on methods for one-pass classification modeling of very large data sets. Our model for data stream classification views the data stream classification problem from the point of view of a dynamic approach in which simultaneous training and testing streams are used for dynamic classification of data sets. This model reflects real life situations effectively, since it is desirable to classify test streams in real time over an evolving training and test stream. The aim here is to create a classification system in which the training model can adapt quickly to the changes of the underlying data stream. In order to achieve this goal, we propose an on-demand classification process which can dynamically select the appropriate window of past training data to build the classifier.

Such a database consists of multiplerelations which are linked together conceptually viaentity-relationship links in the design of relational databaseschemas. Multi-relational classification can be widelyused in many disciplines, such as financial decision making,medical research, and geographical applications.However, most classification approaches only work on single\"flat\" data relations. It is usually difficult to convertmultiple relations into a single flat relation without eitherintroducing huge, undesirable \"universal relation\" orlosing essential information. Previous works using InductiveLogic Programming approaches (recently also knownas Relational Mining) have proven effective with high accuracyin multi-relational classification. Unfortunately,they suffer from poor scalability w.r.t. the number of relationsand the number of attributes in databases.In this paper we propose CrossMine, an efficientand scalable approach for multi-relational classification.Several novel methods are developed in CrossMine,including (1) tuple ID propagation, which performssemantics-preserving virtual join to achieve high efficiencyon databases with complex schemas, and (2) a selectivesampling method, which makes it highly scalablew.r.t. the number of tuples in the databases. Both theoreticalbackgrounds and implementation techniques ofCrossMine are introduced.

As a new attempt, this paper studies such matching as a data mining problem. Specifically, while complex matchings are common, because of their far more complex search space, most existing techniques focus on simple 1:1 matchings. To tackle this challenge, this paper takes a conceptually novel approach by viewing schema matching as correlation mining, for our task of matching Web query interfaces to integrate the myriad databases on the Internet. On this \"deep Web,\" query interfaces generally form complex matchings between attribute groups (e.g., {author} corresponds to {first name, last name} in the Books domain). We observe that the co-occurrences patterns across query interfaces often reveal such complex semantic relationships: grouping attributes (e.g., {first name, last name}) tend to be co-present in query interfaces and thus positively correlated. In contrast, synonym attributes are negatively correlated because they rarely co-occur. This insight enables us to discover complex matchings by a correlation mining approach, which consists of dual mining of positive and negative correlations. We evaluate our approach on deep Web sources in several object domains (e.g., Books and Airfares) and the results show that the correlation mining approach does discover semantically meaningful matchings among attributes.", "year": "2004", "venue": "Proceedings of the 9th ACM SIGMOD workshop on Research issues in data mining and knowledge discovery", "citations": ["539098b820f70186a0e0a85d", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6bcf0", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea7800"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfac90", "5390878320f70186a0d32421", "539087be20f70186a0d51fe3", "539087dd20f70186a0d644cc", "5390881220f70186a0d7e323", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2e9", "5390881220f70186a0d7e321", "53908a4020f70186a0d9dc84", "53908a9620f70186a0da492b", "53908b4920f70186a0dbb0b1", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc3d5", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a07", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a0f", "5390958a20f70186a0defdc0", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef5e26"], "authors": ["Bin He", "Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a8f3c60b4bee2df6437e"}}, {"index": "5390985d20f70186a0e06e87", "title": "Substructure similarity search in graph databases", "abstract": "Advanced database systems face a great challenge raised by the emergence of massive, complex structural data in bioinformatics, chem-informatics, and many other applications. The most fundamental support needed in these applications is the efficient search of complex structured data. Since exact matching is often too restrictive, similarity search of complex structures becomes a vital operation that must be supported efficiently.In this paper, we investigate the issues of substructure similarity search using indexed features in graph databases. By transforming the edge relaxation ratio of a query graph into the maximum allowed missing features, our structural filtering algorithm, called Grafil, can filter many graphs without performing pairwise similarity computations. It is further shown that using either too few or too many features can result in poor filtering performance. Thus the challenge is to design an effective feature set selection strategy for filtering. By examining the effect of different feature selection mechanisms, we develop a multi-filter composition strategy, where each filter uses a distinct and complementary subset of the features. We identify the criteria to form effective feature sets for filtering, and demonstrate that combining features with similar size and selectivity can improve the filtering and search performance significantly. Moreover, the concept presented in Grafil can be applied to searching approximate non-consecutive sequences, trees, and other complicated structures as well.", "year": "2005", "venue": "Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data", "citations": ["539099ec20f70186a0e1cb18", "53909a9320f70186a0e2202e", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3f7b1", "53909fbd20f70186a0e41c3e", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4a7c2", "5390a1d420f70186a0e574b8", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d58b", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d64c", "5390a30b20f70186a0e69ca0", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6bc0a", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6bc08", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f725", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75a03", "5390a63c20f70186a0e8324a", "5390a72220f70186a0e8963a", "5390a72220f70186a0e8aedf", "5390a79f20f70186a0e92339", "5390a7f520f70186a0e93579", "5390a8db20f70186a0e9d9c3", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab831", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab873", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb122b", "5390ac1720f70186a0eb2896", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebd0a6", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec52a6", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec5267", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecb126", "5390af8820f70186a0ececcf", "5390afc920f70186a0ed21b1", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed453e", "5390b04120f70186a0ed842b", "5390b04120f70186a0ed8443", "5390b0ca20f70186a0edac3c", "5390b13020f70186a0edd32f", "5390b24320f70186a0ee636f", "5390b36120f70186a0ef0e53", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1456", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1fd4", "5390b48420f70186a0efc2f9", "5390b52620f70186a0f02e8e", "5390b56a20f70186a0f049fd", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0ba99", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0baa7", "5390b5ed20f70186a0f0d969", "5390b5ed20f70186a0f0d94c", "5390b63320f70186a0f17d40", "5390b63320f70186a0f17d41", "5390b78a20f70186a0f2312f", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a10f", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2c003", "5390b95420f70186a0f2e268", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f33595", "5390ba3820f70186a0f357d5", "5390ba3820f70186a0f357d3", "5390be6620f70186a0f4c37d", "5390bed320f70186a0f4e01e", "5390bf1320f70186a0f517b2", "5390bfa220f70186a0f53710", "5390bfa220f70186a0f53a3c", "558b02e2612c41e6b9d404b9", "558af767612c41e6b9d3ee8d", "558b8bcb612c6b62e5e8b38f", "558b24c2612c41e6b9d44b1a", "558af661612c41e6b9d3eb99", "55323b8745cec66b6f9da142", "55323bd445cec66b6f9daac6"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfaca3", "5390878320f70186a0d32dfb", "539087aa20f70186a0d4a43b", "539087d920f70186a0d61d51", "539087eb20f70186a0d6a088", "539087eb20f70186a0d6b52a", "539087ef20f70186a0d6c5eb", "5390881220f70186a0d7e1ec", "5390881720f70186a0d80c62", "5390882420f70186a0d89094", "539088b920f70186a0d9141d", "539089d220f70186a0d9a95d", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa54", "53908a5820f70186a0da126f", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe75"], "authors": ["Xifeng Yan", "Philip S.

Most previous studies require the specification of a min_support threshold and aim at mining a complete set of frequent itemsets satisfying min_support. However, in practice, it is difficult for users to provide an appropriate min_support threshold. In addition, a complete set of frequent itemsets is much less compact than a set of frequent closed itemsets. In this paper, we propose an alternative mining task: mining top-k frequent closed itemsets of length no less than min_l, where k is the desired number of frequent closed itemsets to be mined, and min_l is the minimal length of each itemset. An efficient algorithm, called TFP, is developed for mining such itemsets without mins_support. Starting at min_support = 0 and by making use of the length constraint and the properties of top-k frequent closed itemsets, min_support can be raised effectively and FP-Tree can be pruned dynamically both during and after the construction of the tree using our two proposed methods: the closed node count and descendant_sum. Moreover, mining is further speeded up by employing a top-down and bottom-up combined FP-Tree traversing strategy, a set of search space pruning methods, a fast 2-level hash-indexed result tree, and a novel closed itemset verification scheme. Our extensive performance study shows that TFP has high performance and linear scalability in terms of the database size.", "year": "2005", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "citations": ["53909f2c20f70186a0e37359", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4ee88", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4ee91", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d90d", "5390a2be20f70186a0e63fde", "5390a2e920f70186a0e67933", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6beb7", "5390a45520f70186a0e71241", "5390a45520f70186a0e71af1", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e73ff5", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82e98", "5390a77d20f70186a0e8e275", "5390a96f20f70186a0ea3f59", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea5d55", "5390aaf920f70186a0ead5b6", "5390ac1820f70186a0eb3e9e", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebb69a", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebb707", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebc2eb", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe3e2", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe358", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecb0c1", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecb0e0", "5390b19020f70186a0ee0a55", "5390b24320f70186a0ee6b7a", "5390b29820f70186a0eeb05a", "5390b2fc20f70186a0eef96a", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1047", "5390b36120f70186a0ef13be", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1632", "5390b48420f70186a0efc2ce", "5390b4c320f70186a0efdc0c", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e25b", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e258", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e297", "5390b78a20f70186a0f22b88", "5390b78a20f70186a0f23d5d", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a0f6", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2c01e", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f32da4", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f34db1", "5390bed320f70186a0f4d950", "5390bed320f70186a0f4d9ad", "5390bfa220f70186a0f5361f", "5390bfa220f70186a0f53a3f", "5390bfa220f70186a0f542fa", "558ca0440cf2a5d42f125a27", "558b79fd612c6b62e5e897b5"], "references": ["539087dd20f70186a0d644cc", "539087e720f70186a0d6964e", "539087e720f70186a0d69654", "539087f320f70186a0d6f867", "539087f820f70186a0d7121a", "539087fe20f70186a0d75e4e", "5390880220f70186a0d75ed5", "5390881220f70186a0d7f51f", "5390881720f70186a0d80508", "539089bb20f70186a0d97abf", "53908a5720f70186a0da07ba", "53908a5720f70186a0da0c06", "53908a9620f70186a0da4bb0", "53908a9620f70186a0da4cda", "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9e49", "53908e0020f70186a0dd49c2", "5390958a20f70186a0defdc0", "5390958a20f70186a0df05d0", "5390958a20f70186a0df05fe", "5390958a20f70186a0df0603"], "authors": ["Jianyong Wang", "Jiawei Han", "Ying Lu", "Petre Tzvetkov"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a545c60b4bede9e85018"}}, {"index": "5390b2d720f70186a0eebfa1", "title": "Efficient processing of ranked queries with sweeping selection", "abstract": "Existing methods for top-k ranked query employ techniques including sorting, updating thresholds and materializing views.

systems, telecommunication systems, and other dynamic environments often generate tremendous (potentially infinite) volume of stream data: the volume is too huge to be scanned multiple times. Much of such data resides at rather low level of abstraction, whereas most analysts are interested in relatively high-level dynamic changes (such as trends and outliers). To discover such high-level characteristics, one may need to perform on-line multi-level, multi-dimensional analytical processing of stream data. In this paper, we propose an architecture, called stream_cube, to facilitate on-line, multi-dimensional, multi-level analysis of stream data.For fast online multi-dimensional analysis of stream data, three important techniques are proposed for efficient and effective computation of stream cubes. First, a tilted time frame model is proposed as a multi-resolution model to register time-related data: the more recent data are registered at finer resolution, whereas the more distant data are registered at coarser resolution. This design reduces the overall storage of time-related data and adapts nicely to the data analysis tasks commonly encountered in practice. Second, instead of materializing cuboids at all levels, we propose to maintain a small number of critical layers. Flexible analysis can be efficiently performed based on the concept of observation layer and minimal interesting layer. Third, an efficient stream data cubing algorithm is developed which computes only the layers (cuboids) along a popular path and leaves the other cuboids for query-driven, on-line computation. Based on this design methodology, stream data cube can be constructed and maintained incrementally with a reasonable amount of memory, computation cost, and query response time. This is verified by our substantial performance study.", "year": "2005", "venue": "Distributed and Parallel Databases", "citations": ["53909a0220f70186a0e1f099", "5390a01420f70186a0e47795", "5390a1d420f70186a0e5875e", "5390a1d420f70186a0e586de", "5390a30b20f70186a0e68d65", "5390a45520f70186a0e71b6c", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82e88", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82e7c", "5390a72220f70186a0e88f64", "5390a72220f70186a0e892e0", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea7978", "5390aa7620f70186a0eac503", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe913", "5390af8920f70186a0ecfd3d", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed453a", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed453d", "5390b13020f70186a0edca8d", "5390b13020f70186a0edd346", "5390b13020f70186a0edd706", "5390b20120f70186a0ee42b7", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef5652", "5390b86b20f70186a0f291c8", "5390b86b20f70186a0f291c2", "5390b86b20f70186a0f296ee", "5390b86b20f70186a0f29e53", "5390b9d520f70186a0f30c85", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f32c67", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3da24", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f3fad5", "5390bed320f70186a0f4d68b", "5390c04520f70186a0f579b3", "558bd14e0cf25dbdbb04dc9d", "558b00b6612c41e6b9d4009b", "558b8d32612c6b62e5e8b558", "55323bd345cec66b6f9daaae"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfab91", "5390972920f70186a0dfbe35", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff83", "539087dd20f70186a0d634a2", "539087dd20f70186a0d644a5", "539087f320f70186a0d6f879", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2e2", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2e8", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2e3", "5390881720f70186a0d804c5", "5390882420f70186a0d89091", "539089ab20f70186a0d95012", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fba", "539089ab20f70186a0d96f60", "53908a4020f70186a0d9f4a7", "53908a5720f70186a0da07ba", "53908a9620f70186a0da491c", "53908a9620f70186a0da49da", "53908a9620f70186a0da491a", "53908a9620f70186a0da4e45", "53908b9320f70186a0dc07d2", "5390958a20f70186a0df05cf", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a980", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a97e", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe2a", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe4b", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401ba", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401d5"], "authors": ["Jiawei Han", "Yixin Chen", "Guozhu Dong", "Jian Pei", "Benjamin W.

Previous studies indicated that the evaluation history of program predicates may disclose important clues about underlying bugs. In this paper, we propose a new statistical model-based approach, called SOBER, which localizes software bugs without any prior knowledge of program semantics. Unlike existing statistical debugging approaches that select predicates correlated with program failures, SOBER models evaluation patterns of predicates in both correct and incorrect runs respectively and regards a predicate as bug-relevant if its evaluation pattern in incorrect runs differs significantly from that in correct ones. SOBER features a principled quantification of the pattern difference that measures the bug-relevance of program predicates.We systematically evaluated our approach under the same setting as previous studies. The result demonstrated the power of our approach in bug localization: SOBER can help programmers locate 68 out of 130 bugs in the Siemens suite when programmers are expected to examine no more than 10% of the code, whereas the best previously reported is 52 out of 130. Moreover, with the assistance of SOBER, we found two bugs in bc 1.06 (an arbitrary precision calculator on UNIX/Linux), one of which has never been reported before.", "year": "2005", "venue": "Proceedings of the 10th European software engineering conference held jointly with 13th ACM SIGSOFT international symposium on Foundations of software engineering", "citations": ["5390995d20f70186a0e16028", "539099a220f70186a0e18458", "53909a0220f70186a0e1fead", "53909a0220f70186a0e1feae", "53909a9320f70186a0e21e22", "53909ee020f70186a0e32280", "53909ee020f70186a0e329c7", "53909ee020f70186a0e329ed", "53909f2d20f70186a0e37e4b", "53909f2d20f70186a0e37e4a", "53909f2d20f70186a0e3889c", "53909f2d20f70186a0e39516", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40dc3", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40da1", "53909fbd20f70186a0e41c3f", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4a94e", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4b092", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4eeb7", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4f51d", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4f51b", "5390a17720f70186a0e523e2", "5390a1d420f70186a0e56935", "5390a1d420f70186a0e5745d", "5390a1d420f70186a0e57685", "5390a1e620f70186a0e59221", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d314", "5390a25820f70186a0e5efb4", "5390a40520f70186a0e6eded", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f9aa", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f99e", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e749ee", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e749ed", "5390a54620f70186a0e77ae1", "5390a54720f70186a0e789fc", "5390a63c20f70186a0e814b8", "5390a6b120f70186a0e85e58", "5390a6d920f70186a0e88a64", "5390a77d20f70186a0e8e768", "5390a77d20f70186a0e8edbb", "5390a8db20f70186a0e9d562", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea7c09", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab72a", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab79c", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab79b", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb16eb", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb16ed", "5390ac5720f70186a0eb644f", "5390aca920f70186a0eb9b9a", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebdf2f", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec5267", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec5c12", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec6271", "5390aeba20f70186a0ec9f46", "5390af8920f70186a0ecfbac", "5390afc920f70186a0ed2d08", "5390afc920f70186a0ed2d52", "5390afc920f70186a0ed364f", "5390b04120f70186a0ed67f2", "5390b04120f70186a0ed69fc", "5390b04120f70186a0ed69fd", "5390b04120f70186a0ed8257", "5390b0ca20f70186a0edb7ef", "5390b13020f70186a0edbd21", "5390b13020f70186a0edc8c7", "5390b13020f70186a0edd8ee", "5390b19020f70186a0edf982", "5390b19020f70186a0ee0137", "5390b19020f70186a0ee0139", "5390b4c320f70186a0efd6a4", "5390b4c320f70186a0efd6d4", "5390b4c320f70186a0efda68", "5390b4c420f70186a0eff11d", "5390b4c420f70186a0eff149", "5390b4c420f70186a0eff15e", "5390b4c420f70186a0eff12d", "5390b52620f70186a0f03036", "5390b68720f70186a0f1d46e", "5390b71120f70186a0f1dabf", "5390b71120f70186a0f1dae6", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2989b", "5390ba3820f70186a0f356db", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c30d", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c364", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3cf47", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3dc44", "5390bda020f70186a0f46b58", "5390bda020f70186a0f46ff3", "558b1088612c41e6b9d41f7f", "5390be6620f70186a0f4ce4f", "5390bf1320f70186a0f50cb6", "5390bfa220f70186a0f5358d", "558b093c612c41e6b9d40f35", "558b2438612c41e6b9d44a3a", "558b4074612c41e6b9d477d2", "558b4dae612c41e6b9d48ac7", "558af3a7612c41e6b9d3e656", "558bd34a0cf2e30013db18a1", "558b12af612c41e6b9d42263", "558c2e6b0cf20e727d0f6d01", "558bd2ac0cf20e727d0f2417"], "references": ["5390981d20f70186a0e0586d", "5390981d20f70186a0e05ecd", "5390981d20f70186a0e066a2", "539087e120f70186a0d65482", "539087e120f70186a0d660c7", "539087e720f70186a0d678b9", "539087eb20f70186a0d6acad", "539087fe20f70186a0d755a7", "5390881220f70186a0d7daeb", "5390881220f70186a0d7f6e2", "5390881720f70186a0d803da", "5390893e20f70186a0d92695", "5390893e20f70186a0d926a4", "5390893e20f70186a0d9361e", "53908b0220f70186a0db150c", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc8bb", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbd3b6", "5390956e20f70186a0dedaf8", "5390972920f70186a0dfa41b", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbe643"], "authors": ["Chao Liu", "Xifeng Yan", "Long Fei", "Jiawei Han", "Samuel P.

The most fundamental support needed in these applications is the efficient search of complex structured data. Since exact matching is often too restrictive, similarity search of complex structures becomes a vital operation that must be supported efficiently.In this paper, we investigate the issues of substructure similarity search using indexed features in graph databases. By transforming the edge relaxation ratio of a query graph into the maximum allowed missing features, our structural filtering algorithm, called Grafil, can filter many graphs without performing pairwise similarity computations. It is further shown that using either too few or too many features can result in poor filtering performance. Thus the challenge is to design an effective feature set selection strategy for filtering. By examining the effect of different feature selection mechanisms, we develop a multi-filter composition strategy, where each filter uses a distinct and complementary subset of the features. We identify the criteria to form effective feature sets for filtering, and demonstrate that combining features with similar size and selectivity can improve the filtering and search performance significantly. Moreover, the concept presented in Grafil can be applied to searching approximate non-consecutive sequences, trees, and other complicated structures as well.", "year": "2005", "venue": "Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data", "citations": ["539099ec20f70186a0e1cb18", "53909a9320f70186a0e2202e", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3f7b1", "53909fbd20f70186a0e41c3e", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4a7c2", "5390a1d420f70186a0e574b8", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d58b", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d64c", "5390a30b20f70186a0e69ca0", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6bc0a", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6bc08", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f725", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75a03", "5390a63c20f70186a0e8324a", "5390a72220f70186a0e8963a", "5390a72220f70186a0e8aedf", "5390a79f20f70186a0e92339", "5390a7f520f70186a0e93579", "5390a8db20f70186a0e9d9c3", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab831", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab873", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb122b", "5390ac1720f70186a0eb2896", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebd0a6", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec52a6", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec5267", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecb126", "5390af8820f70186a0ececcf", "5390afc920f70186a0ed21b1", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed453e", "5390b04120f70186a0ed842b", "5390b04120f70186a0ed8443", "5390b0ca20f70186a0edac3c", "5390b13020f70186a0edd32f", "5390b24320f70186a0ee636f", "5390b36120f70186a0ef0e53", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1456", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1fd4", "5390b48420f70186a0efc2f9", "5390b52620f70186a0f02e8e", "5390b56a20f70186a0f049fd", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0ba99", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0baa7", "5390b5ed20f70186a0f0d969", "5390b5ed20f70186a0f0d94c", "5390b63320f70186a0f17d40", "5390b63320f70186a0f17d41", "5390b78a20f70186a0f2312f", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a10f", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2c003", "5390b95420f70186a0f2e268", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f33595", "5390ba3820f70186a0f357d5", "5390ba3820f70186a0f357d3", "5390be6620f70186a0f4c37d", "5390bed320f70186a0f4e01e", "5390bf1320f70186a0f517b2", "5390bfa220f70186a0f53710", "5390bfa220f70186a0f53a3c", "558b02e2612c41e6b9d404b9", "558af767612c41e6b9d3ee8d", "558b8bcb612c6b62e5e8b38f", "558b24c2612c41e6b9d44b1a", "558af661612c41e6b9d3eb99", "55323b8745cec66b6f9da142", "55323bd445cec66b6f9daac6"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfaca3", "5390878320f70186a0d32dfb", "539087aa20f70186a0d4a43b", "539087d920f70186a0d61d51", "539087eb20f70186a0d6a088", "539087eb20f70186a0d6b52a", "539087ef20f70186a0d6c5eb", "5390881220f70186a0d7e1ec", "5390881720f70186a0d80c62", "5390882420f70186a0d89094", "539088b920f70186a0d9141d", "539089d220f70186a0d9a95d", "539089d220f70186a0d9aa54", "53908a5820f70186a0da126f", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe75"], "authors": ["Xifeng Yan", "Philip S.

Most previous studies require the specification of a min_support threshold and aim at mining a complete set of frequent itemsets satisfying min_support. However, in practice, it is difficult for users to provide an appropriate min_support threshold. In addition, a complete set of frequent itemsets is much less compact than a set of frequent closed itemsets. In this paper, we propose an alternative mining task: mining top-k frequent closed itemsets of length no less than min_l, where k is the desired number of frequent closed itemsets to be mined, and min_l is the minimal length of each itemset. An efficient algorithm, called TFP, is developed for mining such itemsets without mins_support. Starting at min_support = 0 and by making use of the length constraint and the properties of top-k frequent closed itemsets, min_support can be raised effectively and FP-Tree can be pruned dynamically both during and after the construction of the tree using our two proposed methods: the closed node count and descendant_sum. Moreover, mining is further speeded up by employing a top-down and bottom-up combined FP-Tree traversing strategy, a set of search space pruning methods, a fast 2-level hash-indexed result tree, and a novel closed itemset verification scheme. Our extensive performance study shows that TFP has high performance and linear scalability in terms of the database size.", "year": "2005", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "citations": ["53909f2c20f70186a0e37359", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4ee88", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4ee91", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d90d", "5390a2be20f70186a0e63fde", "5390a2e920f70186a0e67933", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6beb7", "5390a45520f70186a0e71241", "5390a45520f70186a0e71af1", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e73ff5", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82e98", "5390a77d20f70186a0e8e275", "5390a96f20f70186a0ea3f59", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea5d55", "5390aaf920f70186a0ead5b6", "5390ac1820f70186a0eb3e9e", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebb69a", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebb707", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebc2eb", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe3e2", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe358", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecb0c1", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecb0e0", "5390b19020f70186a0ee0a55", "5390b24320f70186a0ee6b7a", "5390b29820f70186a0eeb05a", "5390b2fc20f70186a0eef96a", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1047", "5390b36120f70186a0ef13be", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1632", "5390b48420f70186a0efc2ce", "5390b4c320f70186a0efdc0c", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e25b", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e258", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e297", "5390b78a20f70186a0f22b88", "5390b78a20f70186a0f23d5d", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a0f6", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2c01e", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f32da4", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f34db1", "5390bed320f70186a0f4d950", "5390bed320f70186a0f4d9ad", "5390bfa220f70186a0f5361f", "5390bfa220f70186a0f53a3f", "5390bfa220f70186a0f542fa", "558ca0440cf2a5d42f125a27", "558b79fd612c6b62e5e897b5"], "references": ["539087dd20f70186a0d644cc", "539087e720f70186a0d6964e", "539087e720f70186a0d69654", "539087f320f70186a0d6f867", "539087f820f70186a0d7121a", "539087fe20f70186a0d75e4e", "5390880220f70186a0d75ed5", "5390881220f70186a0d7f51f", "5390881720f70186a0d80508", "539089bb20f70186a0d97abf", "53908a5720f70186a0da07ba", "53908a5720f70186a0da0c06", "53908a9620f70186a0da4bb0", "53908a9620f70186a0da4cda", "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9e49", "53908e0020f70186a0dd49c2", "5390958a20f70186a0defdc0", "5390958a20f70186a0df05d0", "5390958a20f70186a0df05fe", "5390958a20f70186a0df0603"], "authors": ["Jianyong Wang", "Jiawei Han", "Ying Lu", "Petre Tzvetkov"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a629c60b4bee2dd3a82b"}}, {"index": "5390b2d720f70186a0eebfa1", "title": "Efficient processing of ranked queries with sweeping selection", "abstract": "Existing methods for top-k ranked query employ techniques including sorting, updating thresholds and materializing views. In this paper, we propose two novel index-based techniques for top-k ranked query: (1) indexing the layered skyline, and (2) indexing microclusters of objects into a grid structure. We also develop efficient algorithms for ranked query by locating the answer points during the sweeping of the line/hyperplane of the score function over the indexed objects. Both methods can be easily plugged into typical multi-dimensional database indexes. The comprehensive experiments not only demonstrate that our methods outperform the existing ones, but also illustrate that the application of data mining technique (microclustering) is a useful and

systems, telecommunication systems, and other dynamic environments often generate tremendous (potentially infinite) volume of stream data: the volume is too huge to be scanned multiple times. Much of such data resides at rather low level of abstraction, whereas most analysts are interested in relatively high-level dynamic changes (such as trends and outliers). To discover such high-level characteristics, one may need to perform on-line multi-level, multi-dimensional analytical processing of stream data. In this paper, we propose an architecture, called stream_cube, to facilitate on-line, multi-dimensional, multi-level analysis of stream data.For fast online multi-dimensional analysis of stream data, three important techniques are proposed for efficient and effective computation of stream cubes. First, a tilted time frame model is proposed as a multi-resolution model to register time-related data: the more recent data are registered at finer resolution, whereas the more distant data are registered at coarser resolution. This design reduces the overall storage of time-related data and adapts nicely to the data analysis tasks commonly encountered in practice. Second, instead of materializing cuboids at all levels, we propose to maintain a small number of critical layers. Flexible analysis can be efficiently performed based on the concept of observation layer and minimal interesting layer. Third, an efficient stream data cubing algorithm is developed which computes only the layers (cuboids) along a popular path and leaves the other cuboids for query-driven, on-line computation. Based on this design methodology, stream data cube can be constructed and maintained incrementally with a reasonable amount of memory, computation cost, and query response time. This is verified by our substantial performance study.", "year": "2005", "venue": "Distributed and Parallel Databases", "citations": ["53909a0220f70186a0e1f099", "5390a01420f70186a0e47795", "5390a1d420f70186a0e5875e", "5390a1d420f70186a0e586de", "5390a30b20f70186a0e68d65", "5390a45520f70186a0e71b6c", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82e88", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82e7c", "5390a72220f70186a0e88f64", "5390a72220f70186a0e892e0", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea7978", "5390aa7620f70186a0eac503", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe913", "5390af8920f70186a0ecfd3d", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed453a", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed453d", "5390b13020f70186a0edca8d", "5390b13020f70186a0edd346", "5390b13020f70186a0edd706", "5390b20120f70186a0ee42b7", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef5652", "5390b86b20f70186a0f291c8", "5390b86b20f70186a0f291c2", "5390b86b20f70186a0f296ee", "5390b86b20f70186a0f29e53", "5390b9d520f70186a0f30c85", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f32c67", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3da24", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f3fad5", "5390bed320f70186a0f4d68b", "5390c04520f70186a0f579b3", "558bd14e0cf25dbdbb04dc9d", "558b00b6612c41e6b9d4009b", "558b8d32612c6b62e5e8b558", "55323bd345cec66b6f9daaae"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfab91", "5390972920f70186a0dfbe35", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff83", "539087dd20f70186a0d634a2", "539087dd20f70186a0d644a5", "539087f320f70186a0d6f879", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2e2", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2e8", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2e3", "5390881720f70186a0d804c5", "5390882420f70186a0d89091", "539089ab20f70186a0d95012", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fba", "539089ab20f70186a0d96f60", "53908a4020f70186a0d9f4a7", "53908a5720f70186a0da07ba", "53908a9620f70186a0da491c", "53908a9620f70186a0da49da", "53908a9620f70186a0da491a", "53908a9620f70186a0da4e45", "53908b9320f70186a0dc07d2", "5390958a20f70186a0df05cf", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a980", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a97e", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe2a", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe4b", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401ba", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401d5"], "authors": ["Jiawei Han", "Yixin Chen", "Guozhu Dong", "Jian Pei", "Benjamin W.

Previous studies indicated that the evaluation history of program predicates may disclose important clues about underlying bugs. In this paper, we propose a new statistical model-based approach, called SOBER, which localizes software bugs without any prior knowledge of program semantics. Unlike existing statistical debugging approaches that select predicates correlated with program failures, SOBER models evaluation patterns of predicates in both correct and incorrect runs respectively and regards a predicate as bug-relevant if its evaluation pattern in incorrect runs differs significantly from that in correct ones. SOBER features a principled quantification of the pattern difference that measures the bug-relevance of program predicates.We systematically evaluated our approach under the same setting as previous studies. The result demonstrated the power of our approach in bug localization: SOBER can help programmers locate 68 out of 130 bugs in the Siemens suite when programmers are expected to examine no more than 10% of the code, whereas the best previously reported is 52 out of 130. Moreover, with the assistance of SOBER, we found two bugs in bc 1.06 (an arbitrary precision calculator on UNIX/Linux), one of which has never been reported before.", "year": "2005", "venue": "Proceedings of the 10th European software engineering conference held jointly with 13th ACM SIGSOFT international symposium on Foundations of software engineering", "citations": ["5390995d20f70186a0e16028", "539099a220f70186a0e18458", "53909a0220f70186a0e1fead", "53909a0220f70186a0e1feae", "53909a9320f70186a0e21e22", "53909ee020f70186a0e32280", "53909ee020f70186a0e329c7", "53909ee020f70186a0e329ed", "53909f2d20f70186a0e37e4b", "53909f2d20f70186a0e37e4a", "53909f2d20f70186a0e3889c", "53909f2d20f70186a0e39516", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40dc3", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40da1", "53909fbd20f70186a0e41c3f", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4a94e", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4b092", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4eeb7", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4f51d", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4f51b", "5390a17720f70186a0e523e2", "5390a1d420f70186a0e56935", "5390a1d420f70186a0e5745d", "5390a1d420f70186a0e57685", "5390a1e620f70186a0e59221", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d314", "5390a25820f70186a0e5efb4", "5390a40520f70186a0e6eded", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f9aa", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f99e", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e749ee", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e749ed", "5390a54620f70186a0e77ae1", "5390a54720f70186a0e789fc", "5390a63c20f70186a0e814b8", "5390a6b120f70186a0e85e58", "5390a6d920f70186a0e88a64", "5390a77d20f70186a0e8e768", "5390a77d20f70186a0e8edbb", "5390a8db20f70186a0e9d562", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea7c09", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab72a", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab79c", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab79b", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb16eb", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb16ed", "5390ac5720f70186a0eb644f", "5390aca920f70186a0eb9b9a", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebdf2f", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec5267", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec5c12", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec6271", "5390aeba20f70186a0ec9f46", "5390af8920f70186a0ecfbac", "5390afc920f70186a0ed2d08", "5390afc920f70186a0ed2d52", "5390afc920f70186a0ed364f", "5390b04120f70186a0ed67f2", "5390b04120f70186a0ed69fc", "5390b04120f70186a0ed69fd", "5390b04120f70186a0ed8257", "5390b0ca20f70186a0edb7ef", "5390b13020f70186a0edbd21", "5390b13020f70186a0edc8c7", "5390b13020f70186a0edd8ee", "5390b19020f70186a0edf982", "5390b19020f70186a0ee0137", "5390b19020f70186a0ee0139", "5390b4c320f70186a0efd6a4", "5390b4c320f70186a0efd6d4", "5390b4c320f70186a0efda68", "5390b4c420f70186a0eff11d", "5390b4c420f70186a0eff149", "5390b4c420f70186a0eff15e", "5390b4c420f70186a0eff12d", "5390b52620f70186a0f03036", "5390b68720f70186a0f1d46e", "5390b71120f70186a0f1dabf", "5390b71120f70186a0f1dae6", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2989b", "5390ba3820f70186a0f356db", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c30d", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c364", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3cf47", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3dc44", "5390bda020f70186a0f46b58", "5390bda020f70186a0f46ff3", "558b1088612c41e6b9d41f7f", "5390be6620f70186a0f4ce4f", "5390bf1320f70186a0f50cb6", "5390bfa220f70186a0f5358d", "558b093c612c41e6b9d40f35", "558b2438612c41e6b9d44a3a", "558b4074612c41e6b9d477d2", "558b4dae612c41e6b9d48ac7", "558af3a7612c41e6b9d3e656", "558bd34a0cf2e30013db18a1", "558b12af612c41e6b9d42263", "558c2e6b0cf20e727d0f6d01", "558bd2ac0cf20e727d0f2417"], "references": ["5390981d20f70186a0e0586d", "5390981d20f70186a0e05ecd", "5390981d20f70186a0e066a2", "539087e120f70186a0d65482", "539087e120f70186a0d660c7", "539087e720f70186a0d678b9", "539087eb20f70186a0d6acad", "539087fe20f70186a0d755a7", "5390881220f70186a0d7daeb", "5390881220f70186a0d7f6e2", "5390881720f70186a0d803da", "5390893e20f70186a0d92695", "5390893e20f70186a0d926a4", "5390893e20f70186a0d9361e", "53908b0220f70186a0db150c", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc8bb", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbd3b6", "5390956e20f70186a0dedaf8", "5390972920f70186a0dfa41b", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbe643"], "authors": ["Chao Liu", "Xifeng Yan", "Long Fei", "Jiawei Han", "Samuel P.

Most previous studies require the specification of a min_support threshold for mining a complete set of sequential patterns satisfying the threshold. However, in practice, it is difficult for users to provide an appropriate min_support threshold. To overcome this difficulty, we propose an alternative mining task: mining top-k frequent closed sequential patterns of length no less than min_\u2113, where k is the desired number of closed sequential patterns to be mined and min_\u2113 is the minimal length of each pattern. We mine the set of closed patterns because it is a compact representation of the complete set of frequent patterns. An efficient algorithm, called TSP, is developed for mining such patterns without min_support. Starting at (absolute) min_support=1, the algorithm makes use of the length constraint and the properties of top-k closed sequential patterns to perform dynamic support raising and projected database pruning. Our extensive performance study shows that TSP has high performance. In most cases, it outperforms the efficient closed sequential pattern-mining algorithm, CloSpan, even when the latter is running with the best tuned min_support threshold. Thus, we conclude that, for sequential pattern mining, mining top-k frequent closed sequential patterns without min_support is more preferable than the traditional min_support-based mining.", "year": "2005", "venue": "Knowledge and Information Systems", "citations": ["53909ed120f70186a0e2fcdb", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d515", "5390a2be20f70186a0e63fde", "5390a2be20f70186a0e64932", "5390a40520f70186a0e70a56", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7e981", "5390ad0620f70186a0ebab74", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebb69a", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda9cc", "5390b13020f70186a0edd3f1", "5390b4c320f70186a0efdc0c", "5390b78a20f70186a0f236dc", "5390b78a20f70186a0f23d5d", "5390bda020f70186a0f465d4", "5390bed320f70186a0f4d950"], "references": ["5390880220f70186a0d75ed5", "5390880720f70186a0d7879c", "5390880d20f70186a0d7d1be", "5390893e20f70186a0d93028", "53908a4020f70186a0d9f494", "53908a5720f70186a0da07ba", "53908a5720f70186a0da0bff", "53908a7420f70186a0da4681", "53908a9620f70186a0da4bb0", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc3ff", "53908bde20f70186a0dc9481", "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9dd6", "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9e1d", "5390958a20f70186a0df05d5"], "authors": ["Petre Tzvetkov", "Xifeng Yan", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a687c60b4bee2dd88154"}}, {"index": "5390985d20f70186a0e06e9d", "title": "GraphMiner: a structural pattern-mining system for large disk-based graph databases and its applications", "abstract": "Mining frequent structural patterns from graph databases is an important research problem with broad applications.

In this paper we develop an algorithm, called Par-CSP (Parallel Closed Sequential Pattern mining), to conduct parallel mining of closed sequential patterns on a distributed memory system. Par-CSP partitions the work among the processors by exploiting the divide-and-conquer property so that the overhead of interprocessor communication is minimized. Par-CSP applies dynamic scheduling to avoid processor idling. Moreover, it employs a technique, called selective sampling to address the load imbalance problem.

In many cases, a high min_sup threshold may discover only commonsense patterns but a low one may generate an explosive number of output patterns, which severely restricts its usage.In this paper, we study the problem of compressing frequent-pattern sets. Typically, frequent patterns can be clustered with a tightness measure \u03b4 (called \u03b4-cluster), and a representative pattern can be selected for each cluster. Unfortunately, finding a minimum set of representative patterns is NP-Hard. We develop two greedy methods, RPglobal and RPlocal. The former has the guaranteed compression bound but higher computational complexity. The latter sacrifices the theoretical bounds but is far more efficient. Our performance study shows that the compression quality using RPlocal is very close to RPglobal, and both can reduce the number of closed frequent patterns by almost two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, RPlocal mines even faster than FPClose[11], a very fast closed frequent-pattern mining method. We also show that RPglobal and RPlocal can be combined together to balance the quality and efficiency.", "year": "2005", "venue": "VLDB '05 Proceedings of the 31st international conference on Very large data bases", "citations": ["539099b320f70186a0e19a28", "539099b320f70186a0e19a64", "539099b320f70186a0e19a33", "539099b320f70186a0e19a2f", "53909ee020f70186a0e31e85", "53909f8220f70186a0e3c790", "53909fbc20f70186a0e41c16", "5390a0b720f70186a0e50042", "5390a17720f70186a0e5243d", "5390a17720f70186a0e5245d", "5390a1d420f70186a0e57f6d", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d849", "5390a25820f70186a0e5e859", "5390a25820f70186a0e5e888", "5390a25820f70186a0e5fddf", "5390a28020f70186a0e62de6", "5390a2be20f70186a0e64fd9", "5390a30b20f70186a0e6ab1e", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e7502d", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e7502a", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75012", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e759b1", "5390a63c20f70186a0e8286b", "5390a72220f70186a0e892a2", "5390a79f20f70186a0e9232e", "5390a88c20f70186a0e99eb0", "5390a96f20f70186a0ea3e57", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea622a", "5390aa7620f70186a0eaa3c7", "5390aa7620f70186a0eaa85a", "5390aaf920f70186a0eada72", "5390ac1720f70186a0eb286f", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba8fd", "5390ad0620f70186a0ebab7c", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec66e8", "5390af8920f70186a0ed01d7", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed58fb", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda9a5", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda9ac", "5390b13020f70186a0edd8cb", "5390b13020f70186a0eddc03", "5390b29820f70186a0eeaea5", "5390b36120f70186a0ef106a", "5390b4c320f70186a0efd6f8", "5390b56a20f70186a0f060a6", "5390b63320f70186a0f16959", "5390b64020f70186a0f19362", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e258", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e27f", "5390b72e20f70186a0f2205a", "5390b86b20f70186a0f283e9", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d101", "5390bded20f70186a0f48355", "558b23b4612c41e6b9d448ad", "558b2741612c41e6b9d4508f", "558afbe2612c41e6b9d3f935"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe02", "539087be20f70186a0d51fe3", "539087dd20f70186a0d644cc", "539087e720f70186a0d69654", "539087f820f70186a0d711d6", "5390880220f70186a0d75ed5", "5390893e20f70186a0d9235e", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fc4", "53908a5720f70186a0d9fff0", "53908a5720f70186a0da07ba", "53908a5820f70186a0da1283", "53908a7420f70186a0da449a", "53908a9620f70186a0da4bb0", "5390958a20f70186a0df05d0"], "authors": ["Dong Xin", "Jiawei Han", "Xifeng Yan", "Hong Cheng"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a711c60b4bee2ddec4b7"}}, {"index": "539098dd20f70186a0e0eace", "title": "Image clustering with tensor representation", "abstract": "We consider the problem of image representation and clustering. Traditionally, an n1 x n2 image is represented by a vector in the Euclidean space &Ropf; n1 x n2. Some learning algorithms are then applied to these vectors in such a high dimensional space for dimensionality reduction, classification, and clustering. However, an image is intrinsically a matrix, or the second order tensor. The vector representation of the images ignores the spatial relationships between the pixels in an image. In this paper, we introduce a tensor framework for image analysis. We represent the images as points in the tensor space Rn1 mathcal Rn2 which is a tensor product of two vector spaces. Based on the tensor representation, we propose a novel image representation and clustering algorithm which explicitly considers the manifold structure of the tensor space. By preserving the local structure of the data manifold, we can obtain a tensor subspace which is optimal for data representation in the sense of local isometry. We call it TensorImage approach. Traditional clustering algorithm such as k-means is then applied in the tensor subspace. Our algorithm shares many of the data representation and clustering properties of other techniques such as Locality Preserving Projections, Laplacian Eigenmaps, and spectral clustering, yet our algorithm is much more computationally efficient.

One important problem is to identify recurrent patterns across multiple networks to discover biological modules. However, existing algorithms for frequent pattern mining become very costly in time and space as the pattern sizes and network numbers increase. Currently, no efficient algorithm is available for mining recurrent patterns across large collections of genome-wide networks. Results: We developed a novel algorithm, CODENSE, to efficiently mine frequent coherent dense subgraphs across large numbers of massive graphs. Compared with previous methods, our approach is scalable in the number and size of the input graphs and adjustable in terms of exact or approximate pattern mining. Applying CODENSE to 39 co-expression networks derived from microarray datasets, we discovered a large number of functionally homogeneous clusters and made functional predictions for 169 uncharacterized yeast genes.

However, data in most real-life applications are high-dimensional in nature, and the related information often spreads across multiple relations. To ensure effective and efficient high-dimensional, cross-relational clustering, we propose a new approach, called CrossClus, which performs cross-relational clustering with user's guidance. We believe that user's guidance, even likely in very simple forms, could be essential for effective high-dimensional clustering since a user knows well the application requirements and data semantics. CrossClus is carried out as follows: A user specifies a clustering task and selects one or a small set of features pertinent to the task. CrossClus extracts the set of highly relevant features in multiple relations connected via linkages defined in the database schema, evaluates their effectiveness based on user's guidance, and identifies interesting clusters that fit user's needs. This method takes care of both quality in feature extraction and efficiency in clustering.

However, the bottleneck of frequent-pattern mining is not at the efficiency but at the interpretability, due to the huge number of patterns generated by the mining process.In this paper, we examine how to summarize a collection of itemset patterns using only K representatives, a small number of patterns that a user can handle easily. The K representatives should not only cover most of the frequent patterns but also approximate their supports. A generative model is built to extract and profile these representatives, under which the supports of the patterns can be easily recovered without consulting the original dataset.

Community mining is one of the major directions in social network analysis. Most of the existing methods on community mining assume that there is only one kind of relation in the network, and moreover, the mining results are independent of the users' needs or preferences. However, in reality, there exist multiple, heterogeneous social networks, each representing a particular kind of relationship, and each kind of relationship may play a distinct role in a particular task. Thus mining networks by assuming only one kind of relation may miss a lot of valuable hidden community information and may not be adaptable to the diverse information needs from different users.In this paper, we systematically analyze the problem of mining hidden communities on heterogeneous social networks. Based on the observation that different relations have different importance with respect to a certain query, we propose a new method for learning an optimal linear combination of these relations which can best meet the user's expectation. With the obtained relation, better performance can be achieved for community mining. Our approach to social network analysis and community mining represents a major shift in methodology from the traditional one, a shift from single-network, user-independent analysis to multi-network, user-dependant, and query-based analysis.

The major difficulty lies in the gap between low-level image features and high-level image semantics. To address the problem, this study reports a framework for effective image retrieval by employing a novel idea of memory learning. It forms a knowledge memory model to store the semantic information by simply accumulating user-provided interactions. A learning strategy is then applied to predict the semantic relationships among images according to the memorized knowledge. Image queries are finally performed based on a seamless combination of low-level features and learned semantics. One important advantage of our framework is its ability to efficiently annotate images and also propagate the keyword annotation from the labeled images to unlabeled images. The presented algorithm has been integrated into a practical image retrieval system.

The number of cells often is so large that the result cannot be realistically searched without pushing the constraint into the search. Previous works have pushed antimonotone and monotone constraints. However, many useful constraints are neither antimonotone nor monotone. We consider a general class of aggregate constraints of the form f(v)\\theta \\sigma, where f is an arithmetic function of SQL-like aggregates and \\theta is one of . We propose a novel pushing technique, called Divide-and-Approximate, to push such constraints. The idea is to recursively divide the search space and approximate the given constraint using antimonotone or monotone constraints in subspaces.

Most of these algorithms only take a single table as input, whereas in the real world most data are stored in multiple tables and managed by relational database systems. As transferring data from multiple tables into a single one usually causes many problems, development of multi-relational classification algorithms becomes important and attracts many researchers' interests. Existing works about extending Na\u00efve Bayes to deal with multi-relational data either have to transform data stored in tables to main-memory Prolog facts, or limit the search space to only a small subset of real world applications. In this work, we aim at solving these problems and building an efficient, accurate Na\u00efve Bayesian classifier to deal with data in multiple tables directly. We propose an algorithm named Graph-NB, which upgrades Na\u00efve Bayesian classifier to deal with multiple tables directly. In order to take advantage of linkage relationships among tables, and treat different tables linked to the target table differently, a semantic relationship graph is developed to describe the relationship and to avoid unnecessary joins. Furthermore, to improve accuracy, a pruning strategy is given to simplify the graph to avoid examining too many weakly linked tables.

We show that the compact index built under this model can achieve better performance in processing graph queries. Since discriminative frequent structures capture the intrinsic characteristics of the data, they are relatively stable to database updates, thus facilitating sampling-based feature extraction and incremental index maintenance.

However, despite these prominent properties, SVMs are usually not chosen for large-scale data mining problems because their training complexity is highly dependent on the data set size. Unlike traditional pattern recognition and machine learning, real-world data mining applications often involve huge numbers of data records. Thus it is too expensive to perform multiple scans on the entire data set, and it is also infeasible to put the data set in memory. This paper presents a method, Clustering-Based SVM (CB-SVM), that maximizes the SVM performance for very large data sets given a limited amount of resource, e.g., memory. CB-SVM applies a hierarchical micro-clustering algorithm that scans the entire data set only once to provide an SVM with high quality samples. These samples carry statistical summaries of the data and maximize the benefit of learning. Our analyses show that the training complexity of CB-SVM is quadratically dependent on the number of support vectors, which is usually much less than that of the entire data set. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets show that CB-SVM is highly scalable for very large data sets and very accurate in terms of classification.", "year": "2005", "venue": "Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery", "citations": ["53909a0220f70186a0e1fb31", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5ce5e", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7f68f", "5390a74f20f70186a0e8bc6d", "5390aefb20f70186a0ecc449", "5390b48420f70186a0efc289", "5390b64020f70186a0f1933c", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a53f"], "references": ["539087d920f70186a0d5ff7a", "539087e720f70186a0d69653", "539087ef20f70186a0d6e61e", "539087ef20f70186a0d6e61f", "5390880720f70186a0d78761", "5390881720f70186a0d804c3", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fd2", "539089bb20f70186a0d9967f", "53908a4020f70186a0d9f221", "53908a5820f70186a0da118e", "53908a5820f70186a0da1362", "53908b2a20f70186a0db9747", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc3ea", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc3e3", "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9e1c", "5390958920f70186a0dee9c8", "5390958920f70186a0deea6b", "5390994d20f70186a0e12f4d"], "authors": ["Hwanjo Yu", "Jiong Yang", "Jiawei Han", "Xiaolei Li"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a8a3c60b4bee2df2375b"}}, {"index": "5390981d20f70186a0e069a6", "title": "A sampling-based framework for parallel data mining", "abstract": "The goal of data mining algorithm is to discover useful information embedded in large databases.

Research in frequent pattern mining has so far mostly focused on developing efficient algorithms to discover various kinds of frequent patterns, but little attention has been paid to the important nextstep - interpreting the discovered frequent patterns. Although some recent work has studied the compression and summarization of frequent patterns, the proposed techniques can only annotate a frequent pattern with non-semantical information (e.g. support), which provides only limited help for a user to understand the patterns.In this paper, we propose the novel problem of generating semantic annotations for frequent patterns. The goal is to annotate a frequent pattern with in-depth, concise, and structured information that can better indicate the hidden meanings of the pattern. We propose a general approach to generate such anannotation for a frequent pattern by constructing its context model, selecting informative context indicators, and extracting representative transactions and semantically similar patterns. This general approach has potentially many applications such as generating a dictionary-like description for a pattern, finding synonym patterns, discovering semantic relations, and summarizing semantic classes of a set of frequent patterns. Experiments on different datasets show that our approach is effective in generating semantic pattern annotations.", "year": "2006", "venue": "Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["53909f2d20f70186a0e3953f", "5390a40520f70186a0e70a56", "5390a88c20f70186a0e99eb0", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecb0fa", "5390afc920f70186a0ed1510", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed546d", "5390b4c420f70186a0efe634", "558b89d1612c6b62e5e8b02b", "558b8ad0612c6b62e5e8b1dc"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe02", "539098b820f70186a0e0a851", "539098b820f70186a0e0ad9b", "539087b320f70186a0d4fd1f", "539087be20f70186a0d51fe3", "539087dd20f70186a0d644cc", "539087e720f70186a0d69654", "539087f820f70186a0d72cb2", "5390880d20f70186a0d7b2e0", "5390881720f70186a0d804e2", "539089ab20f70186a0d95166", "53908a5720f70186a0da07ba", "53908bde20f70186a0dc9481", "53908bde20f70186a0dc94c1", "5390958a20f70186a0defddb", "5390958a20f70186a0df03cd"], "authors": ["Qiaozhu Mei", "Dong Xin", "Hong Cheng", "Jiawei Han", "ChengXiang Zhai"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a52ac60b4bede9e730e4"}}, {"index": "53909ee020f70186a0e32280", "title": "Statistical Debugging: A Hypothesis Testing-Based Approach", "abstract": "Manual debugging is tedious, as well as costly. The high cost has motivated the development of fault localization techniques, which help developers search for fault locations. In this paper, we propose a new statistical method, called Sober, which automatically localizes software faults without any prior knowledge of the program semantics. Unlike existing statistical approaches that select predicates correlated with program failures, Sober models the predicate evaluation in both correct and incorrect executions and regards a predicate as fault-relevant if its evaluation pattern in incorrect executions significantly diverges from that in correct ones. Featuring a rationale similar to that of hypothesis testing, Sober quantifies the fault relevance of each predicate in a principled way. We systematically evaluate Sober under the same setting as previous studies. The result clearly demonstrates the effectiveness: Sober could help developers locate 68 out of the 130 faults in the Siemens suite by examining no more than 10 percent of the code, whereas the Cause Transition approach proposed by Holger et al. [6] and the statistical approach by Liblit et al. [12] locate 34 and 52 faults, respectively. Moreover, the effectiveness of Sober is also evaluated in an \"imperfect world,\u201d where the test suite is either inadequate or only partially labeled. The experiments indicate that Sober could achieve competitive quality under these harsh circumstances.

It is further shown that using either too few or too many features can result in poor filtering performance. Thus the challenge is to design an effective feature set selection strategy that could maximize the filtering capability. We prove that the complexity of optimal feature set selection is \u03a9(2m) in the worst case, where m is the number of features for selection.

As a departure from the traditional data cube, we propose a new warehousing model that preserves object transitions while providing significant compression and path-dependent aggregates, based on the following observations: (1) items usually move together in large groups through early stages in the system (e.g., distribution centers) and only in later stages (e.g., stores) do they move in smaller groups, and (2) although RFID data is registered at the primitive level, data analysis usually takes place at a higher abstraction level.

In this dissertation, we investigate two long standing fundamental problems: Given a graph data set, what are the hidden structural patterns and how can we find them? and how can we index graphs and perform similarity search in large graph data sets? Graph pattern mining is an expensive computational problem since subgraph isomorphism is NP-complete. Previous solutions generate inevitable overheads since they rely on joining two graphs to form larger candidates. We develop a graph canonical labeling system, gSpan, showing both theoretically and empirically that this kind of join operation is unnecessary. Graph indexing, the second problem addressed in this dissertation, may incur an exponential number of index entries if all of the substructures in a graph database are used for indexing. The solution, gIndex, proposes a novel, frequent and discriminative graph mining approach that leads to the development of a compact but effective graph index structure that is orders of magnitude smaller in size but an order of magnitude faster in performance than traditional approaches.Besides graph mining and search, this dissertation provides thorough investigation of pattern summarization, pattern-based classification, constraint pattern mining, and graph similarity searching, which could leverage the usage of graph patterns. It also explores several critical applications in bioinformatics, computer systems and software engineering, including gene relevance network analysis for functional annotation, and program flow analysis for automated software bug isolation.The developed concepts, theories, and systems may significantly deepen the understanding of data mining principles in structural pattern discovery, interpretation and search.

The volume of data generated by a typical RFID application will be enormous as each item will generate a complete history of all the individual locations that it occupied at every point in time, possibly from a specific production line at a given factory, passing through multiple warehouses, and all the way to a particular checkout counter in a store. The movement trails of such RFID data form gigantic commodity flowgraph representing the locations and durations of the path stages traversed by each item. This commodity flow contains rich multi-dimensional information on the characteristics, trends, changes and outliers of commodity movements.In this paper, we propose a method to construct a warehouse of commodity flows, called flowcube. As in standard OLAP, the model will be composed of cuboids that aggregate item flows at a given abstraction level. The flowcube differs from the traditional data cube in two major ways. First, the measure of each cell will not be a scalar aggregate but a commodity flowgraph that captures the major movement trends and significant deviations of the items aggregated in the cell. Second, each flowgraph itself can be viewed at multiple levels by changing the level of abstraction of path stages. In this paper, we motivate the importance of the model, and present an efficient method to compute it by (1) performing simultaneous aggregation of paths to all interesting abstraction levels, (2) pruning low support path segments along the item and path stage abstraction lattices, and (3) compressing the cube by removing rarely occurring cells, and cells whose commodity flows can be inferred from higher level cells.", "year": "2006", "venue": "VLDB '06 Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases", "citations": ["53909a0320f70186a0e2044d", "53909fbc20f70186a0e41c33", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c03a", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c6fe", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c6e3", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4f8cd", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e5421d", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e5579e", "5390a40520f70186a0e6eec0", "5390a55520f70186a0e79cc8", "5390a72220f70186a0e89667", "5390aa7620f70186a0eaa5ee", "5390aa7620f70186a0eac503", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebd0a3", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe9f2", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec8cbb", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed453d", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3fb5", "5390b20120f70186a0ee580f", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1018", "5390b63320f70186a0f167d6", "5390b9d520f70186a0f30c85", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3cffa", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40c34", "5390bed320f70186a0f4d67e", "558b91e2612c6b62e5e8bc2e"], "references": ["5390995d20f70186a0e15298", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff83", "539087f320f70186a0d6f879", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2e2", "5390881720f70186a0d80507", "53908a4020f70186a0d9f4a3", "53908a5820f70186a0da123c", "53908a5820f70186a0da12b7", "53908a7420f70186a0da453c", "53908a9620f70186a0da4cda", "53908a9620f70186a0da4d84", "53908a9620f70186a0da4e45", "53908ac620f70186a0da999a", "53908cde20f70186a0dce4b3", "5390962020f70186a0df5a90", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe4b", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401f1"], "authors": ["Hector Gonzalez", "Jiawei Han", "Xiaolei Li"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a596c60b4bede9eb6fcd"}}, {"index": "539099b320f70186a0e19a28", "title": "Generating semantic annotations for frequent patterns with context analysis", "abstract": "As a fundamental data mining task, frequent pattern mining has widespread applications in many different domains. Research in frequent pattern mining has so far mostly focused on developing efficient algorithms to discover various kinds of frequent patterns, but little attention has been paid to the important nextstep - interpreting the discovered frequent patterns. Although some recent work has studied the compression and summarization of frequent patterns, the proposed techniques can only annotate a frequent pattern with non-semantical information (e.g. support), which provides only limited help for a user to understand the patterns.In this paper, we propose the novel problem of generating semantic annotations for frequent patterns. The goal is to annotate a frequent pattern with in-depth, concise, and structured information that can better indicate the hidden meanings of the pattern. We propose a general approach to generate such anannotation for a frequent pattern by constructing its context model, selecting informative context indicators, and extracting representative transactions and semantically similar patterns. This general approach has potentially many applications such as generating a dictionary-like description for a pattern, finding synonym patterns, discovering semantic relations, and summarizing semantic classes of a set of frequent patterns. Experiments on different datasets show that our approach is effective in generating semantic pattern annotations.", "year": "2006", "venue": "Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["53909f2d20f70186a0e3953f", "5390a40520f70186a0e70a56", "5390a88c20f70186a0e99eb0", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecb0fa", "5390afc920f70186a0ed1510", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed546d", "5390b4c420f70186a0efe634", "558b89d1612c6b62e5e8b02b", "558b8ad0612c6b62e5e8b1dc"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe02", "539098b820f70186a0e0a851", "539098b820f70186a0e0ad9b", "539087b320f70186a0d4fd1f", "539087be20f70186a0d51fe3", "539087dd20f70186a0d644cc", "539087e720f70186a0d69654", "539087f820f70186a0d72cb2", "5390880d20f70186a0d7b2e0", "5390881720f70186a0d804e2", "539089ab20f70186a0d95166", "53908a5720f70186a0da07ba", "53908bde20f70186a0dc9481", "53908bde20f70186a0dc94c1", "5390958a20f70186a0defddb", "5390958a20f70186a0df03cd"], "authors": ["Qiaozhu Mei", "Dong Xin", "Hong Cheng", "Jiawei Han", "ChengXiang Zhai"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a613c60b4bee2dd288f7"}}, {"index": "53909ee020f70186a0e32280", "title": "Statistical Debugging: A Hypothesis Testing-Based Approach", "abstract": "Manual debugging is tedious, as well as costly. The high cost has motivated the development of fault localization techniques, which help developers search for fault locations. In this paper, we propose a new statistical method, called Sober, which automatically localizes software faults without any prior knowledge of the program semantics. Unlike existing statistical approaches that select predicates correlated with program failures, Sober models the predicate evaluation in both correct and incorrect executions and regards a predicate as fault-relevant if its evaluation pattern in incorrect executions significantly diverges from that in correct ones. Featuring a rationale similar to that of hypothesis testing, Sober quantifies the fault relevance of each predicate in a principled way. We systematically evaluate Sober under the same setting as previous studies. The result clearly demonstrates the effectiveness: Sober could help developers locate 68 out of the 130 faults in the Siemens suite by examining no more than 10 percent of the code, whereas the Cause Transition approach proposed by Holger et al. [6] and the statistical approach by Liblit et al. [12] locate 34 and 52 faults, respectively. Moreover, the effectiveness of Sober is also evaluated in an \"imperfect world,\u201d where the test suite is either inadequate or only partially labeled.

In this article, we investigate the issues of substructure similarity search using indexed features in graph databases. By transforming the edge relaxation ratio of a query graph into the maximum allowed feature misses, our structural filtering algorithm can filter graphs without performing pairwise similarity computation. It is further shown that using either too few or too many features can result in poor filtering performance. Thus the challenge is to design an effective feature set selection strategy that could maximize the filtering capability. We prove that the complexity of optimal feature set selection is \u03a9(2m) in the worst case, where m is the number of features for selection. In practice, we identify several criteria to build effective feature sets for filtering, and demonstrate that combining features with similar size and selectivity can improve the filtering and search performance significantly within a multifilter composition framework.

In the near future, it is expected that every major retailer will use RFID systems to track the movement of products from suppliers to warehouses, store backrooms and eventually to points of sale. The volume of information generated by such systems can be enormous as each individual item (a pallet, a case, or an SKU) will leave a trail of data as it moves through different locations. As a departure from the traditional data cube, we propose a new warehousing model that preserves object transitions while providing significant compression and path-dependent aggregates, based on the following observations: (1) items usually move together in large groups through early stages in the system (e.g., distribution centers) and only in later stages (e.g., stores) do they move in smaller groups, and (2) although RFID data is registered at the primitive level, data analysis usually takes place at a higher abstraction level.

In this dissertation, we investigate two long standing fundamental problems: Given a graph data set, what are the hidden structural patterns and how can we find them? and how can we index graphs and perform similarity search in large graph data sets? Graph pattern mining is an expensive computational problem since subgraph isomorphism is NP-complete. Previous solutions generate inevitable overheads since they rely on joining two graphs to form larger candidates. We develop a graph canonical labeling system, gSpan, showing both theoretically and empirically that this kind of join operation is unnecessary. Graph indexing, the second problem addressed in this dissertation, may incur an exponential number of index entries if all of the substructures in a graph database are used for indexing. The solution, gIndex, proposes a novel, frequent and discriminative graph mining approach that leads to the development of a compact but effective graph index structure that is orders of magnitude smaller in size but an order of magnitude faster in performance than traditional approaches.Besides graph mining and search, this dissertation provides thorough investigation of pattern summarization, pattern-based classification, constraint pattern mining, and graph similarity searching, which could leverage the usage of graph patterns. It also explores several critical applications in bioinformatics, computer systems and software engineering, including gene relevance network analysis for functional annotation, and program flow analysis for automated software bug isolation.The developed concepts, theories, and systems may significantly deepen the understanding of data mining principles in structural pattern discovery, interpretation and search. The formulation of a general graph information system through this study could provide fundamental supports to graph-intensive applications in multiple domains.", "year": "2006", "venue": "Mining, indexing and similarity search in large graph data sets", "citations": ["5390b7fe20f70186a0f27341"], "references": [], "authors": ["Jiawei Han", "Xifeng Yan"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a65ec60b4bee2dd676b5"}}, {"index": "539099ec20f70186a0e1cb47", "title": "Flowcube: constructing RFID flowcubes for multi-dimensional analysis of commodity flows", "abstract": "With the advent of RFID (Radio Frequency Identication) technology, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers will be able to track the movement of individual objects throughout the supply chain. The volume of data generated by a typical RFID application will be enormous as each item will generate a complete history of all the individual locations that it occupied at every point in time, possibly from a specific production line at a given factory, passing through multiple warehouses, and all the way to a particular checkout counter in a store. The movement trails of such RFID data form gigantic commodity flowgraph representing the locations and durations of the path stages traversed by each item. This commodity flow contains rich multi-dimensional information on the characteristics, trends, changes and outliers of commodity movements.In this paper, we propose a method to construct a warehouse of commodity flows, called flowcube. As in standard OLAP, the model will be composed of cuboids that aggregate item flows at a given abstraction level. The flowcube differs from the traditional data cube in two major ways. First, the measure of each cell will not be a scalar aggregate but a commodity flowgraph that captures the major movement trends and significant deviations of the items aggregated in the cell. Second, each flowgraph itself can be viewed at multiple levels by changing the level of abstraction of path stages. In this paper, we motivate the importance of the model, and present an efficient method to compute it by (1) performing simultaneous aggregation of paths to all interesting abstraction levels, (2) pruning low support path segments along the item and path stage abstraction lattices, and (3) compressing the cube by removing rarely occurring cells, and cells whose commodity flows can be inferred from higher level cells.", "year": "2006", "venue": "VLDB '06 Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases", "citations": ["53909a0320f70186a0e2044d", "53909fbc20f70186a0e41c33", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c03a", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c6fe", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c6e3", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4f8cd", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e5421d", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e5579e", "5390a40520f70186a0e6eec0", "5390a55520f70186a0e79cc8", "5390a72220f70186a0e89667", "5390aa7620f70186a0eaa5ee", "5390aa7620f70186a0eac503", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebd0a3", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe9f2", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec8cbb", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed453d", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3fb5", "5390b20120f70186a0ee580f", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1018", "5390b63320f70186a0f167d6", "5390b9d520f70186a0f30c85", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3cffa", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40c34", "5390bed320f70186a0f4d67e", "558b91e2612c6b62e5e8bc2e"], "references": ["5390995d20f70186a0e15298", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff83", "539087f320f70186a0d6f879", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2e2", "5390881720f70186a0d80507", "53908a4020f70186a0d9f4a3", "53908a5820f70186a0da123c", "53908a5820f70186a0da12b7", "53908a7420f70186a0da453c", "53908a9620f70186a0da4cda", "53908a9620f70186a0da4d84", "53908a9620f70186a0da4e45", "53908ac620f70186a0da999a", "53908cde20f70186a0dce4b3", "5390962020f70186a0df5a90", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe4b", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401f1"], "authors": ["Hector Gonzalez", "Jiawei Han", "Xiaolei Li"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a664c60b4bee2dd6c7e0"}}, {"index": "5390b64020f70186a0f1a5b8", "title": "Unsupervised extraction of visual attention objects in color images", "abstract": "This paper proposes a generic model for unsupervised extraction of viewer's attention objects from color images.

Existing algorithms for simple distributive and algebraic measures are inadequate for efficient computation of statistical measures in a multidimensional space. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally new class of measures, compressible measures, in order to support efficient computation of the statistical models. For compressible measures, we compress each cell into an auxiliary matrix with a size independent of the number of tuples. We can then compute the statistical measures for any data cell from the compressed data of the lower-level cells without accessing the raw data.

Anomaly detection in massive sets of moving objects has many important applications, especially in surveillance, law enforcement, and homeland security. Due to the sheer volume of spatiotemporal and non-spatial data (such as weather and object type) associated with moving objects, it is challenging to develop a method that can efficiently and effectively detect anomalies in complex scenarios. The problem is further complicated by the fact that anomalies may occur at various levels of abstraction and be associated with different time and location granularities. In this paper, we analyze the problem of anomaly detection in moving objects and propose an efficient and scalable classification method, Motion-Alert, which proceeds with the following three steps. Object movement features, called motifs, are extracted from the object paths. Each path consists of a sequence of motif expressions, associated with the values related to time and location. To discover anomalies in object movements, motif-based generalization is performed that clusters similar object movement fragments and generalizes the movements based on the associated motifs. With motif-based generalization, objects are put into a multi-level feature space and are classified by a classifier that can handle high-dimensional feature spaces. We implemented the above method as one of the core components in our moving-object anomaly detection system, motion-alert. Our experiments show that the system is more accurate than traditional classification techniques.", "year": "2006", "venue": "ISI'06 Proceedings of the 4th IEEE international conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics", "citations": ["5390a1d420f70186a0e56991", "5390a96e20f70186a0ea2abe", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebafc8", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f3391a", "55323d1d45cec66b6f9dd94e"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfacbc", "5390972920f70186a0dfacbb", "5390972920f70186a0dfbe06", "5390972920f70186a0dfbe28", "5390979920f70186a0dffd83", "5390981d20f70186a0e04553", "5390981d20f70186a0e04552", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a97b", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe4e", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe65", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401ce", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401d5", "5390aefc20f70186a0ece0ac", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff7a", "539087f820f70186a0d711dd", "5390880220f70186a0d75f0b", "5390880220f70186a0d78255", "5390880720f70186a0d798fa", "5390881220f70186a0d7d9c8", "539088b920f70186a0d919d2", "53908a4020f70186a0d9dc82", "53908a9620f70186a0da4cf1", "53908aac20f70186a0da82f5", "53908af920f70186a0dafe66", "53908af920f70186a0daff0d", "53908af920f70186a0daff90", "53908af920f70186a0daff0c", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a1a", "53908d6520f70186a0dd26d7", "5390958920f70186a0dee243", "5390b44620f70186a0ef819f", "5390b44620f70186a0ef819d"], "authors": ["Xiaolei Li", "Jiawei Han", "Sangkyum Kim"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a765c60b4bee2de2b1e2"}}, {"index": "5390995d20f70186a0e14e63", "title": "A Framework for On-Demand Classification of Evolving Data Streams", "abstract": "Current models of the classification problem do not effectively handle bursts of particular classes coming in at different times. In fact, the current model of the classification problem simply concentrates on methods for one-pass classification modeling of very large data sets. Our model for data stream classification views the data stream classification problem from the point of view of a dynamic approach in which simultaneous training and test streams are used for dynamic classification of data sets. This model reflects real-life situations effectively, since it is desirable to classify test streams in real time over an evolving training and test stream. The aim here is to create a classification system in which the training model can adapt quickly to the changes of the underlying data stream. In order to achieve this goal, we propose an on-demand classification process which can dynamically select the appropriate window of past training data to build the classifier.

In many applications, the goal is to find these objects that best match a set of keywords. However, the keywords may not necessarily occur in the target objects; they occur only in the documents. For example, in a product review database, a user might search for names of products (say, laptops) using keywords like \"lightweight\" and \"business use\" that occur only in the reviews but not in the names of laptops. In order to answer these queries, we need to exploit relationships between documents containing the keywords and the target objects related to those documents. Current keyword query paradigms do not exploit these relationships effectively and hence are inefficient for these queries.In this paper, we consider a class of queries called the \"object finder\" queries. Our main intuition is to exploit the relationships between searchable documents and related objects and further \"aggregate\" the document scores from these relationships in order to find the best ranking target objects. Building upon existing keyword search engines such as full text search, we design efficient algorithms that exploit the requirement of only the best k target objects to terminate early. The main challenge here is to push early termination through blocking operators such as group by and aggregation. Our experiments with real datasets and workloads demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques.

A user may not only propose ad hoc ranking functions, but also use different interesting subsets of the data. In many cases, a user may want to have a thorough study of the data by initiating a multi-dimensional analysis of the top-k query results. Previous work on top-k query processing mainly focuses on optimizing data access according to the ranking function only. The problem of efficient answering top-k queries with multi-dimensional selections has not been well addressed yet.This paper proposes a new computational model, called ranking cube, for efficient answering top-k queries with multi-dimensional selections. We define a rank-aware measure for the cube, capturing our goal of responding to multi-dimensional ranking analysis. Based on the ranking cube, an efficient query algorithm is developed which progressively retrieves data blocks until the top-k results are found. The curse of dimensionality is a well-known challenge for the data cube and we cope with this difficulty by introducing a new technique of ranking fragments.

In comparison with a previous study (SimRank) that computes links recursively on all pairs of objects, we take advantage of the power law distribution of links, and develop a hierarchical structure called SimTree to represent similarities in multi-granularity manner. This method avoids the high cost of computing and storing pairwise similarities but still thoroughly explore relationships among objects. An efficient algorithm is proposed to compute similarities between objects by avoiding pairwise similarity computations through merging computations that go through the same branches in the SimTree. Experiments show the proposed approach achieves high efficiency, scalability, and accuracy in clustering multi-typed linked objects.", "year": "2006", "venue": "VLDB '06 Proceedings of the 32nd international conference on Very large data bases", "citations": ["53909f2d20f70186a0e39517", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a5ee", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40d0d", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40d1d", "53909fbd20f70186a0e41c61", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c748", "5390a1d420f70186a0e57fa6", "5390a25820f70186a0e5e8c3", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6bc28", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f0a2", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f736", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f7a0", "5390a40520f70186a0e6fc8f", "5390a45520f70186a0e713c2", "5390a63c20f70186a0e81caf", "5390a63c20f70186a0e8283a", "5390a72220f70186a0e89450", "5390a72220f70186a0e89639", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea77f4", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec67d6", "5390aefc20f70186a0ece099", "5390af8920f70186a0ecfeb1", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda98b", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda999", "5390b13020f70186a0edd747", "5390b4c320f70186a0efd445", "5390b72e20f70186a0f20634", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2b3c1", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f34c41", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f34dae", "5390ba3820f70186a0f36aef", "5390bd1520f70186a0f4417f", "5390bd1520f70186a0f44337", "5390bfa220f70186a0f53ce6", "558afd58612c41e6b9d3fc51", "55323b8245cec66b6f9da110"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe09", "5390981d20f70186a0e05a27", "539098b820f70186a0e0a854", "539098dc20f70186a0e0d7eb", "5390990f20f70186a0e0f1d2", "539087be20f70186a0d51fe3", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff7a", "539087e720f70186a0d69653", "539087f320f70186a0d6f860", "539087f820f70186a0d71f36", "53908a5820f70186a0da1d49", "53908a9620f70186a0da4ba7", "53908b2120f70186a0db5a59", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc410", "53908bde20f70186a0dc9481", "53908cde20f70186a0dcdfee", "5390958a20f70186a0df05d0", "5390958a20f70186a0df05c1"], "authors": ["Xiaoxin Yin", "Jiawei Han", "Philip S.

In a relational database, multiple relations are linked together via entity-relationship links. Multirelational classification is the procedure of building a classifier based on information stored in multiple relations and making predictions with it. Existing approaches of Inductive Logic Programming (recently, also known as Relational Mining) have proven effective with high accuracy in multirelational classification. Unfortunately, most of them suffer from scalability problems with regard to the number of relations in databases. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called CrossMine, which includes a set of novel and powerful methods for multirelational classification, including 1) tuple ID propagation, an efficient and flexible method for virtually joining relations, which enables convenient search among different relations, 2) new definitions for predicates and decision-tree nodes, which involve aggregated information to provide essential statistics for classification, and 3) a selective sampling method for improving scalability with regard to the number of tuples. Based on these techniques, we propose two scalable and accurate methods for multirelational classification: CrossMine-Rule, a rule-based method and CrossMine-Tree, a decision-tree-based method. Our comprehensive experiments on both real and synthetic data sets demonstrate the high scalability and accuracy of the CrossMine approach.", "year": "2006", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "citations": ["53909fca20f70186a0e4518f", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d6ec", "5390a79f20f70186a0e92915", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab8ad", "5390aeba20f70186a0eca40d", "5390b2d720f70186a0eec277", "5390b71120f70186a0f1ee4a", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f34124", "5390ba3820f70186a0f36c05", "5390bfa220f70186a0f53d23", "5390bfa220f70186a0f542fc", "558aee07612c41e6b9d3d9f7", "558aee29612c41e6b9d3da60"], "references": ["5390879d20f70186a0d44ec1", "539087ae20f70186a0d4df1b", "5390882420f70186a0d88847", "5390882c20f70186a0d8cd30", "5390882c20f70186a0d8d572", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fde", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fd2", "53908a4020f70186a0d9dc96", "53908a4020f70186a0d9f1a7", "53908a5820f70186a0da1034", "53908a7420f70186a0da45c9", "53908ac620f70186a0da9989", "5390958a20f70186a0df0601", "5390a6b120f70186a0e84363", "5390a6d920f70186a0e8878e"], "authors": ["Xiaoxin Yin", "Jiawei Han", "Jiong Yang", "Philip S.

Compression is achieved based on the following observations: (1) only a relatively small minority of items deviate from the general trend, (2)only truly non-redundant deviations, ie, those that substantially deviate from the previously recorded ones, are interesting, and (3) although RFID data is registered at the primitive level, data analysis usually takes place at a higher abstraction level.

A company, if less self-disciplined, may be tempted to plagiarize some open source projects for its own products. Although current plagiarism detection tools appear sufficient for academic use, they are nevertheless short for fighting against serious plagiarists. For example, disguises like statement reordering and code insertion can effectively confuse these tools. In this paper, we develop a new plagiarism detection tool, called GPLAG, which detects plagiarism by mining program dependence graphs (PDGs). A PDG is a graphic representation of the data and control dependencies within a procedure. Because PDGs are nearly invariant during plagiarism, GPLAG is more effective than state-of-the-art tools for plagiarism detection. In order to make GPLAG scalable to large programs, a statistical lossy filter is proposed to prune the plagiarism search space. Experiment study shows that GPLAG is both effective and efficient: It detects plagiarism that easily slips over existing tools, and it usually takes a few seconds to find (simulated) plagiarism in programs having thousands of lines of code.", "year": "2006", "venue": "Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["53909f2d20f70186a0e37e58", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4a95a", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4e65e", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4f0ea", "5390a1bc20f70186a0e54cb2", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6c4a1", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f372", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f7be", "5390a4d020f70186a0e7646c", "5390a72220f70186a0e8aec1", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb13b2", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb180b", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec52a6", "5390afc920f70186a0ed37b5", "5390afc920f70186a0ed3785", "5390b19020f70186a0edfa35", "5390b29820f70186a0eeab57", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef330a", "5390b48420f70186a0efad98", "5390b4c420f70186a0efea0c", "5390b64020f70186a0f1aaf5", "5390b68720f70186a0f1d45c", "5390b71120f70186a0f1dad8", "5390b71120f70186a0f1dadd", "5390b72e20f70186a0f2071e", "5390b9d520f70186a0f2ff16", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f34c3c", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f34c43", "5390bae520f70186a0f3b8d5", "5390bae520f70186a0f3b944", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3cfac", "5390bd1520f70186a0f440b6", "5390bda020f70186a0f45e84", "5390bda020f70186a0f46040", "5390bda020f70186a0f46b76", "5390bded20f70186a0f488fc", "5390bed320f70186a0f4e1e0", "558b2b26612c41e6b9d4576b", "558b2cd9612c41e6b9d45c07", "558b39aa612c41e6b9d472e3", "558b4772612c41e6b9d47f93", "558b321d612c41e6b9d465c3", "558b335e612c41e6b9d46689", "558c04c90cf25dbdbb051017", "558c1b2a0cf23f2dfc5979ea", "558fca8f612c29c89cd7b1e1", "558bd2ac0cf20e727d0f2417", "559158380cf232eb904fbd75", "558b3fe8612c41e6b9d47789"], "references": ["539098b820f70186a0e0a7c7", "5390877f20f70186a0d31723", "539087f920f70186a0d7335b", "539088b920f70186a0d9141d", "539089d320f70186a0d9beba", "53908bad20f70186a0dc1fa2", "53908bde20f70186a0dc7848", "53908bde20f70186a0dc7779", "53908bde20f70186a0dc8601", "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9e49", "53908bfb20f70186a0dcb2de", "53908d6520f70186a0dd19fb", "5390958a20f70186a0df05d5"], "authors": ["Chao Liu", "Chen Chen", "Jiawei Han", "Philip S.

In the near future, it is expected that every major retailer will use RFID systems to track the movement of products from suppliers to warehouses, store backrooms and eventually to points of sale. The volume of information generated by such systems can be enormous as each individual item (a pallet, a case, or an SKU) will leave a trail of data as it moves through different locations. We propose two data models for the management of this data. The first is a path cube that preserves object transition information while allowing muti-dimensional analysis of path dependent aggregates. The second is a workflow cube that summarizes the major patterns and significant exceptions in the flow of items through the system. The design of our models is based on the following observations: (1) items usually move together in large groups through early stages in the system (e.g., distribution centers) and only in later stages (e.g., stores) do they move in smaller groups, (2) although RFID data is registered at the primitive level, data analysis usually takes place at a higher abstraction level, (3) many items have similar flow patterns and only a relatively small number of them truly deviate from the general trend, and (4) only non-redundant flow deviations with respect to previously recorded deviations are interesting. These observations facilitate the construction of highly compressed RFID data warehouses and the exploration of such data warehouses by scalable data mining. In this study we give a general overview of the principles driving the design of our framework.

There is limited work on finding those top-k patterns which demonstrate high-significance and low-redundancy simultaneously.In this paper, we study the problem of extracting redundancy-aware top-k patterns from a large collection of frequent patterns. We first examine the evaluation functions for measuring the combined significance of a pattern set and propose the MMS (Maximal Marginal Significance) as the problem formulation. The problem is known as NP-hard. We further present a greedy algorithm which approximates the optimal solution with performance bound O(log k) (with conditions on redundancy), where k is the number of reported patterns.

The combined score function is usually linear. To efficiently answer top-k queries, preprocessing and indexing the data have been used to speed up the run time performance. Many indexing methods allow the online query algorithms progressively retrieve the data and stop at a certain point. However, in many cases, the number of data accesses is sensitive to the query parameters (i.e., linear weights in the score functions).In this paper, we study the sequentially layered indexing problem where tuples are put into multiple consecutive layers and any top-k query can be answered by at most k layers of tuples. We propose a new criterion for building the layered index. A layered index is robust if for any k, the number of tuples in the top k layers is minimal in comparison with all the other alternatives. The robust index guarantees the worst case performance for arbitrary query parameters. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for robust index. The problem is shown solvable within O(ndlog n) (where d is the number of dimensions, and n is the number of tuples). To reduce the high complexity of the exact solution, we develop an approximate approach, which has time complexity O(2d n(log n)r(d)-1), where r(d) = \u2308d/2\u2309 + \u230ad/2\u230b \u2308d/2\u2309.

By relaxing the rigid requirement of exact frequent pattern mining, some interesting patterns, which would previously be fragmented by exact pattern mining methods due to the random noise or measurement error, are successfully recovered. Unfortunately, a large number of \"uninteresting\" candidates are explored as well during the mining process, as a result of the relaxed pattern mining methodology. This severely slows down the mining process. Even worse, it is hard for an end user to distinguish the recovered interesting patterns from these uninteresting ones. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm AC-Close to recover the approximate closed itemsets from \"core patterns\".

Besides classical outlier analysis algorithms, recent studies have focused on mining local outliers, i.e., the outliers that have density distribution significantly different from their neighborhood. The estimation of density distribution at the location of an object has so far been based on the density distribution of its k-nearest neighbors [2,11]. However, when outliers are in the location where the density distributions in the neighborhood are significantly different, for example, in the case of objects from a sparse cluster close to a denser cluster, this may result in wrong estimation. To avoid this problem, here we propose a simple but effective measure on local outliers based on a symmetric neighborhood relationship. The proposed measure considers both neighbors and reverse neighbors of an object when estimating its density distribution. As a result, outliers so discovered are more meaningful. To compute such local outliers efficiently, several mining algorithms are developed that detects top-n outliers based on our definition. A comprehensive performance evaluation and analysis shows that our methods are not only efficient in the computation but also more effective in ranking outliers.", "year": "2006", "venue": "PAKDD'06 Proceedings of the 10th Pacific-Asia conference on Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining", "citations": ["53909fbc20f70186a0e41c21", "5390a01420f70186a0e47705", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4f1f9", "5390a17720f70186a0e52442", "5390a1d420f70186a0e57fbb", "5390a45520f70186a0e71c9f", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea04d9", "5390ac1820f70186a0eb3dbe", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed55e9", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef6e19", "5390b56a20f70186a0f066b6", "5390b60d20f70186a0f12b7e", "5390b64020f70186a0f1aa9f", "5390b71120f70186a0f1eee8", "5390b78a20f70186a0f232f2", "5390b78a20f70186a0f2414e", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2888a", "5390b86b20f70186a0f29317", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2b4d1", "5390b9d520f70186a0f306e6", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d13b", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f3fcb4", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40409", "5390bda020f70186a0f467b8", "5390bda020f70186a0f46e6b", "5390be6620f70186a0f4d103", "5390bfa220f70186a0f53fab"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfab7c", "5390972920f70186a0dfacac", "5390975920f70186a0dfd68d", "5390980720f70186a0e040fb", "5390985d20f70186a0e07dc4", "5390985e20f70186a0e09113", "539087d420f70186a0d5df11", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff7a", "539087e720f70186a0d69653", "5390880220f70186a0d75f00", "5390880220f70186a0d75f14", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2e6", "5390881720f70186a0d804eb", "5390881720f70186a0d804de", "53908a7420f70186a0da45cd", "53908a7420f70186a0da4690", "53908a9620f70186a0da4ba7", "53908ac620f70186a0da9c94", "53908b2a20f70186a0db974b", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc998", "5390880220f70186a0d75ee5"], "authors": ["Wen Jin", "Anthony K.

In order to prioritize fault diagnosis, failing traces due to the same fault are expected to be grouped together. Previous methods, by hypothesizing that similar failing traces imply the same fault, cluster failing traces based on the literal trace similarity, which we call trace proximity. However, since a fault can be triggered in many ways, failing traces due to the same fault can be quite different. Therefore, previous methods actually group together traces exhibiting similar behaviors, like similar branch coverage, rather than traces due to the same fault. In this paper, we propose a new type of failure proximity, called R-Proximity, which regards two failing traces as similar if they suggest roughly the same fault location. The fault location each failing case suggests is automatically obtained with Sober, an existing statistical debugging tool. We show that with R-Proximity, failing traces due to the same fault can be grouped together. In addition, we find that R-Proximity is helpful for statistical debugging: It can help developers interpret and utilize the statistical debugging result. We illustrate the usage of R-Proximity with a case study on the grep program and some experiments on the Siemens suite, and the result clearly demonstrates the advantage of R-Proximity over trace proximity.", "year": "2006", "venue": "Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGSOFT international symposium on Foundations of software engineering", "citations": ["53909f2d20f70186a0e37e4b", "53909f6a20f70186a0e3bc88", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40dce", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40da1", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d314", "5390a25820f70186a0e5efb4", "5390a28120f70186a0e63413", "5390a63c20f70186a0e814b8", "5390a6b120f70186a0e84fd9", "5390a77d20f70186a0e8edbc", "5390aa7620f70186a0eaa90e", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb1a01", "5390ac1820f70186a0eb3c80", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec5c12", "5390aeba20f70186a0ec9f50", "5390afc920f70186a0ed37e2", "5390b04120f70186a0ed69fc", "5390b04120f70186a0ed69fd", "5390b04120f70186a0ed7d78", "5390b68720f70186a0f1d46e", "5390b71120f70186a0f1db28", "5390b86b20f70186a0f296e7", "5390baa120f70186a0f37b08", "5390bae520f70186a0f3b907", "5390bda020f70186a0f4594f", "5390be6620f70186a0f4ce4f", "5390bfa220f70186a0f53580", "5390bfa220f70186a0f5358d", "558c2e6b0cf20e727d0f6d01"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfac79", "5390981d20f70186a0e05ecd", "5390981d20f70186a0e066a2", "539098b820f70186a0e0a7c6", "539098b820f70186a0e0a7b6", "539098dc20f70186a0e0c497", "5390990f20f70186a0e0f08d", "5390990f20f70186a0e0f08e", "5390995d20f70186a0e160d3", "5390995d20f70186a0e160e0", "5390881220f70186a0d7f6e2", "5390881720f70186a0d80671", "5390893e20f70186a0d9361e", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc8bb", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbd3b6"], "authors": ["Chao Liu", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a8d8c60b4bee2df4df86"}}, {"index": "53909f2c20f70186a0e37981", "title": "On Efficient Processing of Subspace Skyline Queries on High Dimensional Data", "abstract": "High energy physics scientists analyze large amounts of data looking for interesting events when particles collide.

And more crucially, it provides much faster computation and therefore makes the retrieval system capable of responding to the user's query more efficiently.", "year": "2007", "venue": "Proceedings of the 15th international conference on Multimedia", "citations": ["53909fca20f70186a0e44d45", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4e884", "5390a25820f70186a0e5ec52", "5390a2be20f70186a0e63f5a", "5390aa7620f70186a0eaa5c5", "5390aa7620f70186a0eaa5b6", "5390aaf920f70186a0eaed99", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec8c02", "5390aeba20f70186a0eca09e", "5390af8920f70186a0ecf673", "5390b13020f70186a0edbce9", "5390b20120f70186a0ee59e1", "5390b36120f70186a0ef2045", "5390b64020f70186a0f1a97a", "5390b7fe20f70186a0f271d0", "5390b86b20f70186a0f29fb4", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2b866", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40df0", "5390bd1520f70186a0f43760"], "references": ["5390979920f70186a0dfef6a", "5390979920f70186a0dfef6b", "5390979920f70186a0e01002", "5390980720f70186a0e02062", "539098dd20f70186a0e0eae2", "5390877920f70186a0d2ea56", "53909a0220f70186a0e1fb22", "5390880720f70186a0d78808", "5390880720f70186a0d7a2dc", "5390880720f70186a0d7a2d2", "5390880720f70186a0d7a7be", "5390881720f70186a0d7ff92", "5390881720f70186a0d800d9", "53908b9320f70186a0dc0091", "5390b64020f70186a0f1a208"], "authors": ["Deng Cai", "Xiaofei He", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a65bc60b4bee2dd64f65"}}, {"index": "5390a96f20f70186a0ea3e50", "title": "Exploring the power of links in data mining", "abstract": "Algorithms like PageRank and HITS have been developed in late 1990s to explore links among Web pages to discover authoritative pages and hubs.

We demonstrate that this may not be true, and one actually may never know either \"how\u0094 or \"when\u0094 the distribution changes. Thus, a model that fits well on the observed distribution can have unsatisfactory accuracy on the incoming data. Practically, one can just assume the bare minimum that learning from observed data is better than both random guessing and always predicting exactly the same class label. Importantly, we formally and experimentally demonstrate the robustness of a model averaging and simple voting-based framework for data streams, particularly when incoming data \"continuously follows significantly different\u0094 distributions.

However, a disadvantage of all these approaches is that the learned projective functions are linear combinations of all the original features, thus it is often difficult to interpret the results. In this paper, we propose a novel dimensionality reduction framework, called Unified Sparse Subspace Learning (USSL), for learning sparse projections. USSL casts the problem of learning the projective functions into a regression framework, which facilitates the use of different kinds of regularizers. By using a L1-norm regularizer (lasso), the sparse projections can be efficiently computed.

We developed efficient algorithms to quickly mine out all strands by iterative growth. In the \"build-up\" stage, these strands are grouped up to form the support sets from which all approximate patterns would be identified. A salient feature of our algorithm is its ability to grow the frequent patterns by iteratively assembling building blocks of significant sizes in a local search fashion. By avoiding incremental growth and global search, we achieve greater efficiency without losing the completeness of the mining result.

A new general framework, called gPrune, is proposed to incorporate all the constraints in such a way that they recursively reinforce each other through the entire mining process. A new concept, Pattern-inseparable Data-antimonotonicity, is proposed to handle the structural constraints unique in the context of graph, which, combined with known pruning properties, provides a comprehensive and unified classification framework for structural constraints.

Unfortunately, there is no guarantee for the correctness of information on the web.

In this paper we propose a new problem called Veracity, i.e., conformity to truth, which studies how to find true facts from a large amount of conflicting information on many subjects that is provided by various web sites. We design a general framework for the Veracity problem, and invent an algorithm called TruthFinder, which utilizes the relationships between web sites and their information, i.e., a web site is trustworthy if it provides many pieces of true information, and a piece of information is likely to be true if it is provided by many trustworthy web sites. Our experiments show that TruthFinder successfully finds true facts among conflicting information, and identifies trustworthy web sites better than the popular search engines.", "year": "2007", "venue": "Proceedings of the 13th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390a06e20f70186a0e4c748", "5390a1d420f70186a0e574f3", "5390a1d420f70186a0e58223", "5390a79f20f70186a0e922eb", "5390a79f20f70186a0e92320", "5390a79f20f70186a0e9231f", "5390a7f520f70186a0e93f3b", "5390a88c20f70186a0e993bd", "5390a9a420f70186a0ea495b", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea77f4", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebd182", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe8a5", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec52de", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec52b7", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec84d9", "5390af8820f70186a0eced4d", "5390b13020f70186a0edd0cf", "5390b19020f70186a0edfd5c", "5390b1d220f70186a0ee11cf", "5390b2d720f70186a0eed486", "5390b48420f70186a0efa9b7", "5390b4c420f70186a0efe9fd", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2b3c2", "5390b95420f70186a0f2e14b", "5390b9d520f70186a0f30998", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f33732", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f34d06", "5390ba3820f70186a0f35101", "5390ba3820f70186a0f3736b", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c770", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d396", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d393", "558bd2940cf23f2dfc593bf3", "558b06eb612c41e6b9d40b00", "558bcbed612cf6424275861c", "558af43a612c41e6b9d3e7c4", "55323b8f45cec66b6f9da266", "55323bd245cec66b6f9daa82"], "references": ["5390980720f70186a0e0408c", "539087f820f70186a0d71b96"], "authors": ["Xiaoxin Yin", "Jiawei Han", "Philip S.

These methods consider the image space as a smooth manifold and apply manifold learning techniques to find a Euclidean embedding. Thus, the Euclidean distances in the embedding space can be used as approximations to the geodesic distances on the manifold. A main advantage of these methods is that the relevance feedbacks during retrieval can be naturally incorporated into the system as prior information. In this paper, we consider the retrieval problem as a classification problem on manifold. Instead of learning a distance measure, we aim to learn a classification function on the image manifold. Considering efficiency is a key issue in image retrieval, especially on the Webscale, we propose a novel approach for image retrieval on manifold. This approach is based on a regularized linear regression framework. The local manifold structure and user-provided relevance feedbacks are incorporated into the image retrieval system through a Locality Preserving Regularizer. Extensive experiments are carried out on a large image database which demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "year": "2007", "venue": "Proceedings of the international workshop on Workshop on multimedia information retrieval", "citations": ["5390a74f20f70186a0e8c992", "5390aaf920f70186a0eaed99", "5390aeba20f70186a0eca09e"], "references": ["5390979920f70186a0dfef6a", "5390979920f70186a0dfef6d", "5390979920f70186a0dfef6c", "5390979920f70186a0dfef6b", "5390979920f70186a0dffe77", "5390979920f70186a0e01002", "5390980720f70186a0e02062", "5390985d20f70186a0e07809", "539098dd20f70186a0e0eae2", "53909a0220f70186a0e1fb22", "539087cf20f70186a0d5b2f2", "539087f820f70186a0d718d7", "5390880720f70186a0d78808", "5390880720f70186a0d7a7be", "5390881720f70186a0d7ff92", "53908a7420f70186a0da45ca", "5390958a20f70186a0df03e0", "5390b64020f70186a0f197ee", "5390b64020f70186a0f1a208", "5390b64020f70186a0f1a40a"], "authors": ["Deng Cai", "Xiaofei He", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a75ac60b4bee2de2243d"}}, {"index": "53909fbd20f70186a0e41c3e", "title": "Towards graph containment search and indexing", "abstract": "Given a set of model graphs D and a query graph q, containment search aims to find all model graphs g \u03b5 D such that q contains g (q \u2287 g). Due to the wide adoption of graph models, fast containment search of graph data finds many applications in various domains. In comparison to traditional graph search that retrieves all the graphs containing q (q \u2286 g), containment search has its own indexing characteristics that have not yet been examined. In this paper, we perform a systematic study on these characteristics and propose a contrast subgraph-based indexing model, called cIndex. Contrast subgraphs capture the structure differences between model graphs and query graphs, and are thus perfect for indexing due to their high selectivity. Using a redundancy-aware feature selection process, cIndex can sort out a set of significant and distinctive contrast subgraphs and maximize its indexing capability. We show that it is NP-complete to choose the best set of indexing features, and our greedy algorithm can approximate the one-level optimal index within a ratio of 1-- 1/e. Taking this solution as a base indexing model, we further extend it to accommodate hierarchical indexing methodologies and apply data space clustering and sampling techniques to reduce the index construction time. The proposed methodology provides a general solution to containment search and indexing, not only for graphs, but also for any data with transitive relations as well. Experimental results on real test data show that cIndex achieves near-optimal pruning power on various containment search workloads, and confirms its obvious advantage over indices built for traditional graph search in this new scenario.", "year": "2007", "venue": "VLDB '07 Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases", "citations": ["5390a37f20f70186a0e6bc09", "5390a79f20f70186a0e922f3", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab873", "5390aca920f70186a0eb951c", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebb88f", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebd0a6", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec8d04", "5390b13020f70186a0eddc03", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1fd4", "5390b56a20f70186a0f049fd", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0ba99", "5390b5ed20f70186a0f0d969", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a10e", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a10f", "5390ba3820f70186a0f36f8b", "5390bded20f70186a0f482ce", "5390bf1320f70186a0f50446", "5390bf1320f70186a0f517b2", "558b821f612c6b62e5e8a486", "558af661612c41e6b9d3eb99", "55323bd445cec66b6f9daac6"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfaca3", "5390972920f70186a0dfbe4d", "5390975920f70186a0dfe698", "5390979920f70186a0dff017", "5390981d20f70186a0e05a1c", "5390985d20f70186a0e06e87", "5390995d20f70186a0e1526b", "53909a0220f70186a0e1fb48", "53909e7c20f70186a0e2bebb", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a97e", "5390877f20f70186a0d2f330", "539087d920f70186a0d61d51", "539087dd20f70186a0d633cc", "539087f820f70186a0d711d6", "5390880d20f70186a0d7b1ac", "5390881d20f70186a0d822f0", "5390882420f70186a0d89094", "53908a5820f70186a0da126f", "53908a7420f70186a0da4487", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a00", "5390958a20f70186a0df05d5", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef7181"], "authors": ["Chen Chen", "Xifeng Yan", "Philip S.

Unfortunately, software is still far from bug-free, even for those deployed. Static analysis is a good approach to eliminating numerous bugs, but its conservative nature of analysis unavoidably constrains its capacity. Dynamic analysis, on the other hand, utilizes program runtime execution data, which complements static approaches. This thesis describes three dynamic techniques that leverage program runtime data to improve software quality.First, we present a statistical debugging algorithm, called S OBER, which automatically localizes software faults without any prior knowledge of the program semantics. This statistical debugging alleviates the high cost associated with manual debugging. Featuring a similar rationale to hypothesis testing, SOBER quantifies the fault relevance of each predicate in a principled way. We systematically evaluate S OBER under the same setting as previous studies, and compare S OBER with other seven algorithms. The result clearly demonstrates the advantages of SOBER over existing approaches.Second, we discuss automated program failure triage, which is a closely related problem with automated debugging. Recent software systems usually feature an automated failure reporting component, with which a huge number of failures are collected from software end-users. In order to effectively leverage the valuable program failure data, the collected failures need to be first triaged, i.e., to locate the most severe failures, and to assign them to appropriate developers. Lying in the center of failure triage is failure indexing, which tries to group failures due to the fault together. In this thesis, we propose a statistical debugging-based approach to program failure triage, called R-PROXIMITY, which better indexes failures and facilitates failure assignment than existing approaches. Finally, we describe a program dynamic slicing-based approach to failure indexing, which complements R-PROXIMITY. R-PROXIMITY is a quality failure indexing tool, but its effectiveness relies on a sufficient number of correct executions, which may or may not be available in practice. The proposed dynamic slicing-based approach does not require any correct executions, and hence perfectly complements R-PROXIMITY . All the three techniques are subject to three mid-sized programs grep, gzip, and flex, and the result validates their advancement of the state of the art.", "year": "2007", "venue": "Statistical debugging and automated program failure triage", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["Jiawei Han", "Chao Liu"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a78cc60b4bee2de4926b"}}, {"index": "53909f8220f70186a0e3c790", "title": "Semantic annotation of frequent patterns", "abstract": "Using frequent patterns to analyze data has been one of the fundamental approaches in many data mining applications. Research in frequent pattern mining has so far mostly focused on developing efficient algorithms to discover various kinds of frequent patterns, but little attention has been paid to the important next step\u2014interpreting the discovered frequent patterns. Although the compression and summarization of frequent patterns has been studied in some recent work, the proposed techniques there can only annotate a frequent pattern with nonsemantical information (e.g., support), which provides only limited help for a user to understand the patterns. In this article, we study the novel problem of generating semantic annotations for frequent patterns. The goal is to discover the hidden meanings of a frequent pattern by annotating it with in-depth, concise, and structured information. We propose a general approach to generate such an annotation for a frequent pattern by constructing its context model, selecting informative context indicators, and extracting representative transactions and semantically similar patterns. This general approach can well incorporate the user's prior knowledge, and has potentially many applications, such as generating a dictionary-like description for a pattern, finding synonym patterns, discovering semantic relations, and summarizing semantic classes of a set of frequent patterns.

In this paper, we present BIDE, an efficient algorithm for mining frequent closed sequences without candidate maintenance. It adopts a novel sequence closure checking scheme called BI-Directional Extension and prunes the search space more deeply compared to the previous algorithms by using the BackScan pruning method. A thorough performance study with both sparse and dense, real, and synthetic data sets has demonstrated that BIDE significantly outperforms the previous algorithm: It consumes an order(s) of magnitude less memory and can be more than an order of magnitude faster.

However, these algorithms are nonlinear and only provide the embedding results of training samples. In this paper, we propose a novel linear dimensionality reduction algorithm, called Isometric Projection. Isometric Projection constructs a weighted data graph where the weights are discrete approximations of the geodesic distances on the data manifold. A linear subspace is then obtained by preserving the pairwise distances. In this way, Isometric Projection can be defined everywhere. Comparing to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which is widely used in data processing, our algorithm is more capable of discovering the intrinsic geometrical structure.

Factors affecting road speed, such as weather, time of day, and vehicle type, need to be considered in order to select fast routes that match current driving conditions. Most existing systems compute fastest paths based on road Euclidean distance and a small set of predefined road speeds. However, \"History is often the best teacher\". Historical traffic data or driving patterns are often more useful than the simple Euclidean distance-based computation because people must have good reasons to choose these routes, e.g., they may want to avoid those that pass through high crime areas at night or that likely encounter accidents, road construction, or traffic jams. In this paper, we present an adaptive fastest path algorithm capable of efficiently accounting for important driving and speed patterns mined from a large set of traffic data. The algorithm is based on the following observations: (1) The hierarchy of roads can be used to partition the road network into areas, and different path pre-computation strategies can be used at the area level, (2) we can limit our route search strategy to edges and path segments that are actually frequently traveled in the data, and (3) drivers usually traverse the road network through the largest roads available given the distance of the trip, except if there are small roads with a significant speed advantage over the large ones. Through an extensive experimental evaluation on real road networks we show that our algorithm provides desirable (short and well-supported) routes, and that it is significantly faster than competing methods.", "year": "2007", "venue": "VLDB '07 Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on Very large data bases", "citations": ["5390a72220f70186a0e8af12", "5390a72220f70186a0e8af20", "5390a8db20f70186a0e9d9b9", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb1ac9", "5390aca820f70186a0eb8755", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba330", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba333", "5390ad8920f70186a0ebff41", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda946", "5390b13020f70186a0eddc7e", "5390b13020f70186a0edddaf", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3de7", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3de6", "5390b29820f70186a0eea5c4", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1641", "5390b56a20f70186a0f04e76", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0ba7f", "5390b63320f70186a0f16c31", "5390b71120f70186a0f1f71a", "5390b78a20f70186a0f24419", "5390baa120f70186a0f383ed", "5390baa120f70186a0f383fb", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c31c", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40c9a", "5390bda020f70186a0f46018", "5390bded20f70186a0f49550", "5390bfa220f70186a0f542f8", "558b884a612c6b62e5e8ad70", "558b052c612c41e6b9d4088f", "558b196e612c41e6b9d43328", "558b9344612c6b62e5e8be51", "559151860cf232eb904fbbb6", "55323b8d45cec66b6f9da24f", "55323bd245cec66b6f9daa68"], "references": ["5390995d20f70186a0e1524f", "5390995d20f70186a0e15298", "539099a220f70186a0e181f9", "539099ec20f70186a0e1cb47", "539087d920f70186a0d6116e", "539087ef20f70186a0d6df51", "539087fe20f70186a0d7579b", "5390880d20f70186a0d7c985", "5390881220f70186a0d7f511", "5390882420f70186a0d884d9", "539089d320f70186a0d9c38b", "53908a5720f70186a0da07ba", "53908a5720f70186a0da08fa", "53908a5720f70186a0da0bff", "53908a7420f70186a0da45c9", "53908b4920f70186a0dbb312", "53908b9320f70186a0dc0773", "53908f5b20f70186a0ddaac5", "5390962020f70186a0df5c48", "5390a6b120f70186a0e8449b", "5390b2d720f70186a0eecad5"], "authors": ["Hector Gonzalez", "Jiawei Han", "Xiaolei Li", "Margaret Myslinska", "John Paul Sondag"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a7d3c60b4bee2de74371"}}, {"index": "53909f8c20f70186a0e40d4d", "title": "Regularized locality preserving indexing via spectral regression", "abstract": "We consider the problem of document indexing and representation. Recently, Locality Preserving Indexing (LPI) was proposed for learning a compact document subspace. Different from Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) which is optimal in the sense of global Euclidean structure, LPI is optimal in the sense of local manifold structure. However, LPI is not efficient in time and memory which makes it difficult to be applied to very large data set. Specifically, the computation of LPI involves eigen-decompositions of two dense matrices which is expensive. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called Regularized Locality Preserving Indexing (RLPI). Benefit from recent progresses on spectral graph analysis, we cast the original LPI algorithm into a regression framework which enable us to avoid eigen-decomposition of dense matrices. Also, with the regression based framework, different kinds of regularizers can be naturally incorporated into our algorithm which makes it more flexible. Extensive experimental results show that RLPI obtains similar or better results comparing to LPI and it is significantly faster, which makes it an efficient and effective data preprocessing method for large scale text clustering, classification and retrieval.", "year": "2007", "venue": "Proceedings of the sixteenth ACM conference on Conference on information and knowledge management", "citations": ["53909fca20f70186a0e44d45", "5390a88c20f70186a0e99920", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea0ca2", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba5aa", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe88b", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec516d", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec55dc", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec8c02", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecb38b", "5390af8820f70186a0ecedbe", "5390afc920f70186a0ed257d", "5390b60d20f70186a0f127b8", "5390b7fe20f70186a0f2742f", "5390b86b20f70186a0f295e5", "5390b86b20f70186a0f29612", "5390b9d520f70186a0f30520", "5390baa120f70186a0f380e0", "558b0c1e612c41e6b9d415e9", "558b1beb612c41e6b9d438d8", "558accc8612c41e6b9d3a6cc"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfb080", "5390985e20f70186a0e08e49", "539098dc20f70186a0e0e205", "539087a620f70186a0d49a5a", "539087e720f70186a0d69358", "539087f820f70186a0d7136e", "539087f820f70186a0d71370", "5390880220f70186a0d78206", "5390880720f70186a0d7a2dc", "5390880720f70186a0d7a2d2", "5390881720f70186a0d800d9", "53908a4020f70186a0d9f221", "53908cde20f70186a0dcdfed", "5390958a20f70186a0df03e0", "5390aefc20f70186a0ece0ac"], "authors": ["Deng Cai", "Xiaofei He", "Wei Vivian Zhang", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a7dec60b4bee2de7dfdf"}}, {"index": "5390a1d420f70186a0e569c5", "title": "Association Mining in Large Databases: A Re-examination of Its Measures", "abstract": "In the literature of data mining and statistics, numerous interestingness measures have been proposed to disclose succinct object relationships of association patterns.

Unlike semi-supervised clustering which requires the user to provide a training set, we minimize the user's effort by using a very simple form of user guidance.

They are beneficial to city planners, police departments, real estate developers, and many others. Knowing the hot routes allows the city to better direct traffic or analyze congestion causes. In the past, this problem has largely been addressed with domain knowledge of city. But in recent years, detailed information about vehicles in the road network have become available. With the development and adoption of RFID and other location sensors, an enormous amount of moving object trajectories are being collected and can be used towards finding hot routes. This is a challenging problem due to the complex nature of the data. If objects traveled in organized clusters, it would be straightforward to use a clustering algorithm to find the hot routes. But, in the real world, objects move in unpredictable ways. Variations in speed, time, route, and other factors cause them to travel in rather fleeting \"clusters.\" These properties make the problem difficult for a naive approach. To this end, we propose a new density-based algorithm named FlowScan. Instead of clustering the moving objects, road segments are clustered based on the density of common traffic they share. We implemented FlowScan and tested it under various conditions.

Database search often returns a large collection of results, which poses challenges to both efficient query processing and effective digest of the query results. To address this problem, ranked search has been introduced to database systems. We study the problem of On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) of ranked queries, where ranked queries are conducted in the arbitrary subset of data defined by multi-dimensional selections. While pre-computation and multi-dimensional aggregation is the standard solution for OLAP, materializing dynamic ranking results is unrealistic because the ranking criteria are not known until the query time. To overcome such difficulty, we develop a new ranking cube method that performs semi on-line materialization and semi online computation in this thesis. Its complete life cycle, including cube construction, incremental maintenance, and query processing, is also discussed. We further extend the ranking cube in three dimensions. First, how to answer queries in high-dimensional data. Second, how to answer queries which involves joins over multiple relations.

The projection vectors are commonly obtained by maximizing the between class covariance and simultaneously minimizing the within class covariance. LDA can be performed either in the original input space or in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) into which data points are mapped, which leads to Kernel Discriminant Analysis (KDA). When the data are highly nonlinear distributed, KDA can achieve better performance than LDA. However, computing the projective functions in KDA involves eigen-decomposition of kernel matrix, which is very expensive when a large number of training samples exist. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for kernel discriminant analysis, called Spectral Regression Kernel Discriminant Analysis (SRKDA). By using spectral graph analysis, SRKDA casts discriminant analysis into a regression framework which facilitates both efficient computation and the use of regularization techniques. Specifically, SRKDA only needs to solve a set of regularized regression problems and there is no eigenvector computation involved, which is a huge save of computational cost. Our computational analysis shows that SRKDA is 27 times faster than the ordinary KDA. Moreover, the new formulation makes it very easy to develop incremental version of the algorithm which can fully utilize the computational results of the existing training samples.

We derive new upper bounds on stopping redundancy for all linear codes in general, and for maximum distance separable (MDS) codes specifically, and show how they improve upon previous results. For MDS codes, the new bounds are found by upper-bounding the stopping redundancy by a combinatorial quantity closely related to Turan numbers. (The Turan number, T(v,k,t), is the smallest number of t-subsets of a v-set, such that every k-subset of the v-set contains at least one of the t-subsets.) Asymptotically, we show that the stopping redundancy of MDS codes with length n and minimum distance d >1 is T(n,d-1,d-2)(1+O(n-1)) for fixed d, and is at most T (n,d-1,d-2)(3+O(n-1)) for fixed code dimension k=n-d+1. For d=3,4, we prove that the stopping redundancy of MDS codes is equal to T(n,d-1,d-2), for which exact formulas are known. For d=5, we show that the stopping redundancy of MDS codes is either T(n,4,3) or T(n,4,3)+1", "year": "2007", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory", "citations": ["5390a37f20f70186a0e6cec8", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6cec7", "5390a72220f70186a0e8a1c2", "5390a72220f70186a0e8a5d9", "5390a77d20f70186a0e8e2e1", "5390a77d20f70186a0e8e412", "5390a77d20f70186a0e8e411", "5390a80e20f70186a0e95643", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebec8b", "5390ad8920f70186a0ebfce4", "5390b29820f70186a0eea277", "5390b71120f70186a0f1eb22"], "references": [], "authors": ["J.

In a relational database, multiple relations are linked together via entity-relationship links. Unfortunately, most existing data mining approaches can only handle data stored in single tables, and cannot be applied to relational databases. Therefore, it is an urgent task to design data mining approaches that can discover knowledge from multi-relational data. In this thesis we study three most important data mining tasks in multi-relational environments: classification, clustering, and duplicate detection. Since information is widely spread across multiple relations, the most crucial and common challenge in multi-relational data mining is how to utilize the relational information linked with each object. We rely on two types of information\u2014neighbor tuples and linkages between objects\u2014to analyze the properties of objects and relationships among them. Because of the complexity of multi-relational data, efficiency and scalability are two major concerns in multi-relational data mining. In this thesis we propose scalable and accurate approaches for each data mining task studied. In order to achieve high efficiency and scalability, the approaches utilize novel techniques for virtually joining different relations, single-scan algorithms, and multi-resolutional data structures to dramatically reduce computational costs. Our experiments show that our approaches are highly efficient and scalable, and also achieve high accuracies in multi-relational data mining.", "year": "2007", "venue": "Scalable mining and link analysis across multiple database relations", "citations": ["5390b71120f70186a0f1ee4a"], "references": [], "authors": ["Jiawei Han", "Xiaoxin Yin"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a864c60b4bee2deed449"}}, {"index": "558eb1ba0cf222bc17bc18ff", "title": "Introduction", "abstract": "", "year": "2007", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD)", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a8a4c60b4bee2df24634"}}, {"index": "53909ee020f70186a0e31e46", "title": "Progressive and selective merge: computing top-k with ad-hoc ranking functions", "abstract": "The family of threshold algorithm (ie, TA) has been widely studied for efficiently computing top-k queries. TA uses a sort-merge framework that assumes data lists are pre-sorted, and the ranking functions are monotone. However, in many database applications, attribute values are indexed by tree-structured indices (eg, B-tree, R-tree), and the ranking functions are not necessarily monotone. To answer top-k queries with ad-hoc ranking functions, this paper studies anindex-merge paradigm that performs progressive search over the space of joint states composed by multiple index nodes. We address two challenges for efficient query processing. First, to minimize the search complexity, we present a double-heap algorithm which supports not only progressive state search but also progressive state generation. Second, to avoid unnecessary disk access, we characterize a type of \"empty-state\" that does not contribute to the final results, and propose a new materialization model, join-signature, to prune empty-states. Our performance study shows that the proposed method achieves one order of magnitude speed-up over baseline solutions.", "year": "2007", "venue": "Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data", "citations": ["5390a01420f70186a0e4778c", "5390a01420f70186a0e4777f", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4f849", "5390a1d420f70186a0e584fc", "5390a1d420f70186a0e58ae8", "5390a1e620f70186a0e59525", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e759d0", "5390a54720f70186a0e79177", "5390a55520f70186a0e7962a", "5390a88c20f70186a0e982f4", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb0099", "5390ac1820f70186a0eb3eb1", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec5177", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec52ed", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec8bff", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecbd56", "5390af8920f70186a0ecf772", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed4519", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed452e", "5390b24320f70186a0ee6ad0", "5390b24320f70186a0ee7006", "5390b56a20f70186a0f049f3", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a378", "5390bed320f70186a0f4d9cb", "558ae873612c41e6b9d3d10f"], "references": ["5390980720f70186a0e03331", "5390981d20f70186a0e05b5b", "539098b820f70186a0e0ad95", "539099a220f70186a0e1801d", "539099a220f70186a0e1801e", "539099ec20f70186a0e1cb29", "539099ec20f70186a0e1cb2a", "539099ec20f70186a0e1cb22", "5390877f20f70186a0d31333", "539087be20f70186a0d51fe6", "539087dd20f70186a0d634a2", "539087e720f70186a0d69347", "539087e720f70186a0d69661", "539087f320f70186a0d6f879", "5390880d20f70186a0d7b7c1", "5390881220f70186a0d7e29b", "5390882c20f70186a0d8cd30", "5390882d20f70186a0d8dba5", "53908a5820f70186a0da0caa", "5390958a20f70186a0defcfa"], "authors": ["Dong Xin", "Jiawei Han", "Kevin C.

A major disadvantage of LDA is that it fails to discover the local geometrical structure of the data manifold. In this paper, we introduce a novel linear algorithm for discriminant analysis, called Locality Sensitive Discriminant Analysis (LSDA). When there is no sufficient training samples, local structure is generally more important than global structure for discriminant analysis. By discovering the local manifold structure, LSDA finds a projection which maximizes the margin between data points from different classes at each local area. Specifically, the data points are mapped into a subspace in which the nearby points with the same label are close to each other while the nearby points with different labels are far apart.

"title": "Training Linear Discriminant Analysis in Linear Time", "abstract": "Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) has been a popular method for extracting features which preserve class separability. It has been widely used in many fields of information processing, such as machine learning, data mining, information retrieval, and pattern recognition. However, the computation of LDA involves dense matrices eigen-decomposition which can be computationally expensive both in time and memory. Specifically, LDA has O(mnt + t3) time complexity and requires O(mn + mt + nt) memory, where m is the number of samples, n is the number of features and t = min (m,n). When both m and n are large, it is infeasible to apply LDA. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for discriminant analysis, called Spectral Regression Discriminant Analysis (SRDA). By using spectral graph analysis, SRDA casts discriminant analysis into a regression framework which facilitates both efficient computation and the use of regularization techniques. Our theoretical analysis shows that SRDA can be computed with O(ms) time and O(ms) memory, where s(les n) is the average number of non-zero features in each sample.

Such bugs are not localized to one component that is faulty, but rather result from complex and unexpected interactions between multiple often individually non-faulty components. Moreover, the manifestations of these bugs are often not repeatable, making them particularly hard to find, as the particular sequence of events that invokes the bug may not be easy to reconstruct. Because of the distributed nature of failure scenarios, our tool looks for sequences of events that may be responsible for faulty behavior, as opposed to localized bugs such as a bad pointer in a module. An extensible framework is developed where a front-end collects runtime data logs of the system being debugged and an offline back-end uses frequent discriminative pattern mining to uncover likely causes of failure. We provide a case study of debugging a recent multichannel MAC protocol that was found to exhibit corner cases of poor performance (worse than single channel MAC). The tool helped uncover event sequences that lead to a highly degraded mode of operation. Fixing the problem significantly improved the performance of the protocol.We also provide a detailed analysis of tool overhead in terms of memory requirements and impact on the running application.", "year": "2008", "venue": "Proceedings of the 6th ACM conference on Embedded network sensor systems", "citations": ["5390a54620f70186a0e77ae1", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7f70c", "5390a72220f70186a0e8901e", "5390a72220f70186a0e89016", "5390a74f20f70186a0e8bee0", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea844d", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea8452", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea8454", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea8453", "5390aca920f70186a0eb9c00", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba3e8", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba825", "5390af8920f70186a0ecfb6a", "5390b48420f70186a0efbbef", "5390b64020f70186a0f194e4", "5390b78a20f70186a0f23f76", "5390b78a20f70186a0f24af6", "5390b9d520f70186a0f309eb", "5390ba3820f70186a0f37528", "5390baa120f70186a0f3854b", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d5dd", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f411ad", "5390bd1520f70186a0f440cc", "5390bda020f70186a0f46ff3", "5390bda020f70186a0f470df"], "references": ["5390981d20f70186a0e05b5d", "5390985d20f70186a0e08200", "539098b820f70186a0e09cbc", "539098b820f70186a0e0a7c6", "539098dd20f70186a0e0e2fc", "5390995d20f70186a0e14b40", "5390995d20f70186a0e14b3e", "539099a220f70186a0e190d7", "539099ec20f70186a0e1cf93", "53909a0220f70186a0e1f2d4", "53909a0220f70186a0e1fead", "53909a9320f70186a0e21e22", "53909a9320f70186a0e22c1a", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2e4d1", "53909ee020f70186a0e31e1c", "53909ee020f70186a0e32280", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40f87", "5390a01420f70186a0e474d0", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4ba27", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4ba34", "5390a0b720f70186a0e50975", "539089ab20f70186a0d9736e", "53908a5820f70186a0da0f9d", "53908a9620f70186a0da4bb0", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbd3ab", "5390958920f70186a0deebd5", "5390958a20f70186a0deff91", "539095ba20f70186a0df0d89", "5390a96f20f70186a0ea3c42", "5390ad8920f70186a0ec04cc"], "authors": ["Mohammad Maifi Hasan Khan", "Hieu Khac Le", "Hossein Ahmadi", "Tarek F.

The primary advantage of this framework is to detect outlying sub-trajectories from a trajectory database. Based on this partition-and-detect framework, we develop a trajectory outlier detection algorithm TRAOD. Our algorithm consists of two phases: partitioning and detection. For the first phase, we propose a two-level trajectory partitioning strategy that ensures both high quality and high efficiency.

It often adopts a two-step approach: frequent pattern (or classification rule) mining followed by feature selection (or rule ranking). However, this two-step process could be computationally expensive, especially when the problem scale is large or the minimum support is low. It was observed that frequent pattern mining usually produces a huge number of \"patterns\" that could not only slow down the mining process but also make feature selection hard to complete. In this paper, we propose a direct discriminative pattern mining approach, DDPMine, to tackle the efficiency issue arising from the two-step approach. DDPMine performs a branch-and-bound search for directly mining discriminative patterns without generating the complete pattern set. Instead of selecting best patterns in a batch, we introduce a \"feature-centered\" mining approach that generates discriminative patterns sequentially on a progressively shrinking FP-tree by incrementally eliminating training instances. The instance elimination effectively reduces the problem size iteratively and expedites the mining process. Empirical results show that DDPMine achieves orders of magnitude speedup without any downgrade of classification accuracy.

Third, for data streams that do not have any fixed feature set, such as text streams, an additional feature extraction and selection task must be performed. If the number of candidate features is too large, then traditional feature extraction techniques fail. In order to address the first two challenges, this article proposes a multipartition, multichunk ensemble classifier in which a collection of v classifiers is trained from r consecutive data chunks using v-fold partitioning of the data, yielding an ensemble of such classifiers. This multipartition, multichunk ensemble technique significantly reduces classification error compared to existing single-partition, single-chunk ensemble approaches, wherein a single data chunk is used to train each classifier. To address the third challenge, a feature extraction and selection technique is proposed for data streams that do not have any fixed feature set.

To integrate boolean pruning and preference pruning in a unified framework, we propose signature, a new materialization measure for multi-dimensional group-bys. Based on this, we propose P-Cube (i.e., data cube for preference queries) and study its complete life cycle, including signature generation, compression, decomposition, incremental maintenance and usage for efficient on-line analytical query processing. We present a signature-based progressive algorithm that is able to simultaneously push boolean and preference constraints deep into the database search. Our performance study shows that the proposed method achieves at least one order of magnitude speed-up over existing approaches.", "year": "2008", "venue": "ICDE '08 Proceedings of the 2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering", "citations": ["5390a4d020f70186a0e75fea", "5390a8db20f70186a0e9d025", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebb87d", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebd6e4", "5390af8920f70186a0ecfd3d", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a14a"], "references": [], "authors": ["Dong Xin", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a57ec60b4bede9ea6a5e"}}, {"index": "5390a45620f70186a0e72a67", "title": "Training Linear Discriminant Analysis in Linear Time", "abstract": "Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) has been a popular method for extracting features which preserve class separability. It has been widely used in many fields of information processing, such as machine learning, data mining, information retrieval, and pattern recognition. However, the computation of LDA involves dense matrices eigen-decomposition which can be computationally expensive both in time and memory. Specifically, LDA has O(mnt + t3) time complexity and requires O(mn + mt + nt) memory, where m is the number of samples, n is the number of features and t = min (m,n). When both m and n are large, it is infeasible to apply LDA. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for discriminant analysis, called Spectral Regression Discriminant Analysis (SRDA). By using spectral graph analysis, SRDA casts discriminant analysis into a regression framework which facilitates both efficient computation and the use of regularization techniques. Our theoretical analysis shows that SRDA can be computed with O(ms) time and O(ms) memory, where s(les n) is the average number of non-zero features in each sample.

Such bugs are not localized to one component that is faulty, but rather result from complex and unexpected interactions between multiple often individually non-faulty components. Moreover, the manifestations of these bugs are often not repeatable, making them particularly hard to find, as the particular sequence of events that invokes the bug may not be easy to reconstruct. Because of the distributed nature of failure scenarios, our tool looks for sequences of events that may be responsible for faulty behavior, as opposed to localized bugs such as a bad pointer in a module. An extensible framework is developed where a front-end collects runtime data logs of the system being debugged and an offline back-end uses frequent discriminative pattern mining to uncover likely causes of failure. We provide a case study of debugging a recent multichannel MAC protocol that was found to exhibit corner cases of poor performance (worse than single channel MAC).

The primary advantage of this framework is to detect outlying sub-trajectories from a trajectory database. Based on this partition-and-detect framework, we develop a trajectory outlier detection algorithm TRAOD. Our algorithm consists of two phases: partitioning and detection. For the first phase, we propose a two-level trajectory partitioning strategy that ensures both high quality and high efficiency.

It often adopts a two-step approach: frequent pattern (or classification rule) mining followed by feature selection (or rule ranking). However, this two-step process could be computationally expensive, especially when the problem scale is large or the minimum support is low. It was observed that frequent pattern mining usually produces a huge number of \"patterns\" that could not only slow down the mining process but also make feature selection hard to complete. In this paper, we propose a direct discriminative pattern mining approach, DDPMine, to tackle the efficiency issue arising from the two-step approach. DDPMine performs a branch-and-bound search for directly mining discriminative patterns without generating the complete pattern set. Instead of selecting best patterns in a batch, we introduce a \"feature-centered\" mining approach that generates discriminative patterns sequentially on a progressively shrinking FP-tree by incrementally eliminating training instances. The instance elimination effectively reduces the problem size iteratively and expedites the mining process. Empirical results show that DDPMine achieves orders of magnitude speedup without any downgrade of classification accuracy.

If the number of candidate features is too large, then traditional feature extraction techniques fail. In order to address the first two challenges, this article proposes a multipartition, multichunk ensemble classifier in which a collection of v classifiers is trained from r consecutive data chunks using v-fold partitioning of the data, yielding an ensemble of such classifiers. This multipartition, multichunk ensemble technique significantly reduces classification error compared to existing single-partition, single-chunk ensemble approaches, wherein a single data chunk is used to train each classifier. To address the third challenge, a feature extraction and selection technique is proposed for data streams that do not have any fixed feature set.

For example, television show ratings in the United States are gathered from a sample of roughly 5,000 households. To use the results effectively, the samples are further partitioned in a multidimensional space based on multiple attribute values. This naturally leads to the desirability of OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) over sampling data. However, unlike traditional data, sampling data is inherently uncertain, i.e., not representing the full data in the population. Thus, it is desirable to return not only query results but also the confidence intervals indicating the reliability of the results. Moreover, a certain segment in a multidimensional space may contain none or too few samples. This requires some additional analysis to return trustable results. In this paper we propose a Sampling Cube framework, which efficiently calculates confidence intervals for any multidimensional query and uses the OLAP structure to group similar segments to increase sampling size when needed. Further, to handle high dimensional data, a Sampling Cube Shell method is proposed to effectively reduce the storage requirement while still preserving query result quality.", "year": "2008", "venue": "Proceedings of the 2008 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data", "citations": ["5390ad0620f70186a0eba93a", "5390af8920f70186a0ecfd3d", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed453c"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfacfc", "539098b820f70186a0e0adb2", "539098b820f70186a0e0adb3", "539099ec20f70186a0e1cb51", "53909ce520f70186a0e27e96", "53909f2d20f70186a0e38b9e", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a9a4", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe4b", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401ba", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401bb", "53909fbc20f70186a0e41bf4", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff83", "539087f320f70186a0d6f879", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2e6", "5390882420f70186a0d88847", "53908a5720f70186a0da08f2", "53908a9620f70186a0da4899", "53908cde20f70186a0dcdbe5", "53908d6520f70186a0dd19fa", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1a0f", "5390958920f70186a0deea74"], "authors": ["Xiaolei Li", "Jiawei Han", "Zhijun Yin", "Jae-Gil Lee", "Yizhou Sun"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a682c60b4bee2dd83c65"}}, {"index": "5390a25820f70186a0e5e859", "title": "On effective presentation of graph patterns: a structural representative approach", "abstract": "In the past, quite a few fast algorithms have been developed to mine frequent patterns over graph data, with the large spectrum covering many variants of the problem. However, the real bottleneck for knowledge discovery on graphs is neither efficiency nor scalability, but the usability of patterns that are mined out. Currently, what the state-of-art techniques give is a lengthy list of exact patterns, which are undesirable in the following two aspects: (1) on the micro side, due to various inherent noises or data diversity, exact patterns are usually not too useful in many real applications; and (2) on the macro side, the rigid structural requirement being posed often generates an excessive amount of patterns that are only slightly different from each other, which easily overwhelm the users. In this paper, we study the presentation problem of graph patterns, where structural representatives are deemed as the key mechanism to make the whole strategy effective. As a solution to fill the usability gap, we adopt a two-step smoothing-clustering framework, with the first step adding error tolerance to individual patterns (the micro side), and the second step reducing output cardinality by collapsing multiple structurally similar patterns into one representative (the macro side). This novel, integrative approach is never tried in previous studies, which essentially rolls-up our attention to a more appropriate level that no longer looks into every minute detail. The above framework is general, which may apply under various settings and incorporate a lot of extensions. Empirical studies indicate that a compact group of informative delegates can be achieved on real datasets and the proposed algorithms are both efficient and scalable.", "year": "2008", "venue": "Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management", "citations": ["5390a63c20f70186a0e82e36", "5390a72220f70186a0e8963b", "5390b86b20f70186a0f28a95", "5390bda020f70186a0f45cd3", "5390bfa220f70186a0f542a3"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfaca3", "5390972920f70186a0dfbe4d", "5390972920f70186a0dfbe42", "5390985d20f70186a0e07dd5", "539098b820f70186a0e0a851", "539098b820f70186a0e0ad9b", "539099b320f70186a0e19a5d", "5390a1e620f70186a0e5ac1c", "5390a1e620f70186a0e5ac3f", "539087d920f70186a0d61d51", "539087e720f70186a0d69654", "539089d220f70186a0d9abe2", "53908a5820f70186a0da126f", "53908a9620f70186a0da4bb0", "53908bde20f70186a0dc9458", "53908bde20f70186a0dc9481", "5390958a20f70186a0df05d5", "5390a45620f70186a0e72a80"], "authors": ["Chen Chen", "Cindy Xide Lin", "Xifeng Yan", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a68fc60b4bee2dd8ebd9"}}, {"index": "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c748", "title": "BibNetMiner: mining bibliographic information networks", "abstract": "Online bibliographic databases, such as DBLP in computer science and PubMed in medical sciences, contain abundant information about research publications in different fields.

One of the canonical approaches for topic modeling is Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing, which maximizes the joint probability of documents and terms in the corpus. The major disadvantage of PLSI is that it estimates the probability distribution of each document on the hidden topics independently and the number of parameters in the model grows linearly with the size of the corpus, which leads to serious problems with overfitting. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is proposed to overcome this problem by treating the probability distribution of each document over topics as a hidden random variable. Both of these two methods discover the hidden topics in the Euclidean space. However, there is no convincing evidence that the document space is Euclidean, or flat. Therefore, it is more natural and reasonable to assume that the document space is a manifold, either linear or nonlinear. In this paper, we consider the problem of topic modeling on intrinsic document manifold. Specifically, we propose a novel algorithm called Laplacian Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (LapPLSI) for topic modeling. LapPLSI models the document space as a submanifold embedded in the ambient space and directly performs the topic modeling on this document manifold in question. We compare the proposed LapPLSI approach with PLSI and LDA on three text data sets.

To narrow down this gap, relevance feedback is introduced into image retrieval. With the user provided information, a classifier can be learned to discriminate between positive and negative examples. However, in real world applications, the number of user feedbacks is usually too small comparing to the dimensionality of the image space. Thus, a situation of overfitting may occur. In order to cope with the high dimensionality, we propose a novel supervised method for dimensionality reduction called Maximum Margin Projection (MMP). MMP aims to maximize the margin between positive and negative examples at each local neighborhood. Different from traditional dimensionality reduction algorithms such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) which effectively see only the global Euclidean structure, MMP is designed for discovering the local manifold structure. Therefore, MMP is likely to be more suitable for image retrieval where nearest neighbor search is usually involved. After projecting the images into a lower dimensional subspace, the relevant images get closer to the query image, thus the retrieval performance can be enhanced.

The query execution model follows a candidate generation and verification framework, where the most promising candidate cells are generated using a set of high-level guiding cells. We also identify a bounding principle for effective pruning: once a guiding cell is pruned, all of its children candidate cells can be pruned. We further address the problem of efficient online candidate aggregation and verification by developing a chunk-based execution model to verify a bulk of candidates within a bounded memory buffer.

Towards the solution of this problem, I have developed a comprehensive framework for warehousing, mining, and cleaning large moving object data sets. At the core of my dissertation, is the RFID data warehousing engine. It receives clean data from the cleaning engine, and provides highly compressed data, at multiple levels of abstraction, to the mining engine. The mining engine is composed of three modules. The first, mines commodity flow patterns that identify general flow trends and significant flow exceptions in a large supply chain operation. The second, makes route recommendations, based on observed driving behavior and traffic conditions. And the third, discovers and characterizes a wide variety of traffic anomalies on a road network. RFID data warehousing. A data warehouse is an enterprise level data repository that collects and integrates organizational data in order to provide decision support analysis. At the core of the data warehouse is the data cube, which computes an aggregate measure (e.g., sum, avg, count) for all possible combination of dimensions of a fact table (e.g., sales for 2004, in the northeast). Online analytical processing (OLAP) operations provide the means for exploration and analysis of the data cube. My research on this direction has extended the data cube to handle moving object data sets [42], by significantly compressing such data, and proposing a new aggregation mechanism that preserves its path structure. RFID Data Cleaning. We propose a cleaning framework that takes an RFID data set and a collection of cleaning methods, with associated costs, and induces a cleaning plan that optimizes the overall accuracy-adjusted cleaning costs. The cleaning plan determines the conditions under which inexpensive cleaning methods can be safely applied, the conditions under which more expensive methods are absolutely necessary, and those cases when a combination of several methods is the optimal policy. Mining flow trends. An important application of moving objects is mining movement patterns of objects in supply chain operations. Creating a complete workflow that records all possible commodity movements and that incorporates time will be prohibitively expensive since there can be billions of different location and time combinations. I propose the FlowGraph [41], as a compressed probabilistic workflow, that captures the general flow trends and significant exceptions of a data set. The FlowGraph achieves compression by recording the set of major flow trends, and the set of non-redundant flow exceptions (i.e., abnormal transitions or durations) present in the data. Mining route recommendations. Most existing route planning applications use a fastest path algorithm based on static or dynamic models of road speeds, but such models in general disregard observed driver behavior, and other important factors such as weather, car-pool availability, or vehicle type. We propose a traffic-mining-based path-finding method [43] that mines speed and driving models from historic traffic data, and uses them to compute fast routes that are well supported by historic driving behavior under the set of relevant driving and traffic conditions. Mining traffic anomalies. Identification and characterization of traffic anomalies on massive road networks is a vital component of traffic monitoring [44]. Anomaly identification can be used to reduce congestion, increase safety, and provide transportation engineers with better information for traffic forecasting and road network design. However, due to the size, complexity and dynamics of such transportation networks, it is challenging to automate the process. We propose a multi-dimensional mining framework that can be used to identify a concise set of anomalies from massive traffic monitoring data, and further overlay, contrast, and explore such anomalies in multi-dimensional space.", "year": "2008", "venue": "Mining massive moving object datasets from rfid flow analysis to traffic mining", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["Jiawei Han", "Hector Gonzalez"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a734c60b4bee2de05c93"}}, {"index": "5390a0b720f70186a0e4e874", "title": "Data mining for image/video processing: a promising research frontier", "abstract": "Image and video data contains abundant, rich information for data miners to explore.

However, frequent pattern mining is non-trivial since the number of unique patterns is exponential but many are non-discriminative and correlated. Currently, frequent pattern mining is performed in two sequential steps: enumerating a set of frequent patterns, followed by feature selection. Although many methods have been proposed in the past few years on how to perform each separate step efficiently, there is still limited success in eventually finding highly compact and discriminative patterns. The culprit is due to the inherent nature of this widely adopted two-step approach. This paper discusses these problems and proposes a new and different method. It builds a decision tree that partitions the data onto different nodes. Then at each node, it directly discovers a discriminative pattern to further divide its examples into purer subsets. Since the number of examples towards leaf level is relatively small, the new approach is able to examine patterns with extremely low global support that could not be enumerated on the whole dataset by the two-step method. The discovered feature vectors are more accurate on some of the most difficult graph as well as frequent itemset problems than most recently proposed algorithms but the total size is typically 50% or more smaller. Importantly, the minimum support of some discriminative patterns can be extremely low (e.g. 0.03%). In order to enumerate these low support patterns, state-of-the-art frequent pattern algorithm either cannot finish due to huge memory consumption or have to enumerate 101 to 103 times more patterns before they can even be found.

Our new mining framework, called LEAP (Descending Leap Mine), is developed to exploit the correlation between structural similarity and significance similarity in a way that the most significant pattern could be identified quickly by searching dissimilar graph patterns. Two novel concepts, structural leap search and frequency descending mining, are proposed to support leap search in graph pattern space.

Botnets are used to perform malicious actions, such as launching DDoS attacks, sending spam or phishing emails and so on. Thus, botnets have emerged as a threat to internet community. Peer to Peer (P2P) is a relatively new architecture of botnets [4]. These botnets are distributed, and small. So, they are difficult to locate and destroy. Most of the recent works in P2P botnet are in the analysis phase [4, 5, 6]. On the contrary, our work is aimed at detecting P2P botnets using network traffic mining. Network traffic can be considered as an infinite data stream. So, our data mining approach is specialized for mining stream data. There are two major problems related to stream data classification. First, it is impractical to store and use all the historical data for training, since it would require infinite storage and running time. Second, there may be concept-drift in the data. For example, in the context of botnets, the botmaster usually updates the bot software frequently, which may change the characteristics of botnet traffic, resulting in a concept drift in the data. If there is a concept-drift in the data, we need to refine our hypothesis to accommodate the new concept. Thus, most of the old data must be discarded from the training set. There are two mainstream techniques available for stream data classification: single classifier approach [1], and ensemble classifier approach [10, 9]. Among these, the ensemble classifier is often more robust in handling concept drifts. We also propose an ensemble classification approach for that solves both the problems related to stream data classification. A common approach in classifying stream data is to divide the stream data into equal sized chunks [2, 10, 9, 3]. We also follow this approach. However, instead of storing historical data, we store the trained classifiers. We always store an ensemble A of best K classifiers {A1, ..., AK}. The ensemble A is actually a two-level ensemble. That is, each classifier Ai in the ensemble A is actually a collection (ensemble) of v classifiers. Thus, we build a hierarchy of ensembles, where A is at the top level of the hierarchy, and each of its children Ai is at the middle level. The lowest level (or the leaves) contains the actual classifiers. Each middle-level ensemble Ai is trained with r consecutive data chunks. As soon as a new data chunk appears, we train a new middle-level ensemble An. Let D={Dn, Dn-1, ..., Dn-r+1}, i.e, the most recent r data chunks including Dn. We randomly divide D into v equal parts = {d1, ..., dv}, such that roughly, all the parts have the same number of positive and negative examples. We then build An with v classifiers = {An(1), An(2), ..., An(v)}, where each classifier An(j) is trained with the dataset D - {dj}. We compute the expected error of the ensemble An by testing each classifier An(j) on dj and averaging their error. Finally, we update the top-level ensemble A by replacing a middle-level ensemble Ai(1 \u2264 i \u2264 K) with the new ensemble An, if An has lower error rate than Ai. By introducing this multi-chunk multi-level ensemble, we reduce the expected error by a factor of rv over the single-chunk, single-level ensemble method (e.g. [10]). We prove the effectiveness of our approach both theoretically and empirically. We have several contributions. First, we propose a novel multi-chunk, multi-level ensemble technique for stream data classification, which is a generalization over the existing single-chunk single-level ensemble techniques. Second, we prove the effectiveness of our technique theoretically. Finally, we apply our technique on for detecting P2P botnet traffic, and achieve better detection accuracies than other stream data classification techniques. No botnet detection techniques so far applied the stream classification approach. We believe that the proposed ensemble technique provides a powerful tool for network security and it will encourage the future use of stream data classification in botnet detection.", "year": "2008", "venue": "Proceedings of the 4th annual workshop on Cyber security and information intelligence research: developing strategies to meet the cyber security and information intelligence challenges ahead", "citations": ["5390ae2e20f70186a0ec7489", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f3ff0f", "55914b0e0cf232eb904fba10"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe0e", "53909a0220f70186a0e1f366", "53909fbc20f70186a0e414e7", "5390880720f70186a0d78761", "5390958a20f70186a0df05cf", "5390a1e620f70186a0e5ac1f"], "authors": ["Mohammad M.

With the help of GPS devices, RFID sensors, RADAR, satellites, and other technologies, mobile objects of all sizes, whether it be a tiny cellphone or a giant ocean liner, can be easily tracked around the globe. Many fundamental problems in the database field have found their parallels in the moving object domain. They include indexing and query processing of moving objects over static or continuous queries and similarity search between moving objects. The same has happened with data mining problems as well. Clustering of moving objects is one popular topic; spatial association patterns is another. However, even with the recent attention, there are still many unexplored areas in moving objects research. Specifically, higher semantic level problems remain mostly untouched. One example is anomaly detection. With the ever-increasing focus on video surveillance, many cities are tracking and analyzing vehicles as they move throughout the city. With the ultimate goal of automated reporting and alerting, sophisticated algorithms are needed to evaluate the moving object trajectories. Furthermore, associations with other multi-dimensional features will need to be considered as well. Another example is periodic traffic pattern detection. Everyone is familiar with rush hour traffic in big cities, but extracting and representing them in an efficient and concise manner has not been addressed. To this end, we present our studies in this thesis. With regards to anomaly detection, we present three models to automatically detect moving object anomaly, traffic anomaly, and subspace anomaly. The last of which detects anomalies in a multidimensional space, which is often the case in real world datasets.

More seriously, in many other applications, the input data has very complex structures, but with no initial feature vector representation, such as transaction data (e.g., customer shopping transactions), sequences (e.g., protein sequences and software execution traces), graphs (e.g., chemical compounds and molecules, social and biological networks), semi-structured data (e.g., XML documents), and text data. For both scenarios, a primary question is how to construct a discriminative and compact feature set, on the basis of which, classification could be performed to achieve good classification performance. Although a lot of kernel-based approaches have been proposed to transform the feature space and, as a way to measure the similarity between two data objects, the implicit definition of feature space makes the kernel-based approach hard to interpret, and the high computational complexity makes it hard to scale to large problem sizes. A concrete example of complex structural data classification is classifying chemical compounds to various classes ( e.g., toxic vs. nontoxic, active vs. inactive), where a key challenge is how to construct discriminative graph features. While simple features such as atoms and links are too simple to preserve the structural information, graph kernel methods make it hard to interpret the classifiers. In this dissertation, I proposed to use frequent patterns as higher-order and discriminative features to characterize data, especially complex structural data, and thus enhance the classification power. Towards this goal, I designed a framework of discriminative frequent pattern-based classification which has been shown to improve the classification performance significantly. Theoretical analysis is provided to reveal the association between a feature's frequency and its discriminative power, thus demonstrate that frequent pattern is a good candidate as discriminative feature. Due to the explosive nature of frequent pattern mining, the frequent pattern-based feature construction could be a computational bottleneck, if the whole set of frequent patterns w.r.t. a minimum support threshold are generated. To overcome this computational bottleneck, I proposed two solutions: DDPMine and LEAP which directly mine the most discriminative features without generating the complete set. Both methods have been shown to improve efficiency while maintaining the classification accuracy.I further applied the discriminative frequent pattern-based classification to classifying chemical compounds with very skewed class distribution, which poses challenges for both feature construction and model learning. An ensemble framework which includes the ensembles in both the data space and the feature space is proposed to handle the challenges and shown to achieve good classification performance.In conclusion, the framework of discriminative frequent pattern-based classification could lead to a highly accurate, efficient and interpretable classifier on complex data. The pattern-based classification technique would have great impact in a wide range of applications including text categorization, chemical compound classification, software behavior analysis and so on.", "year": "2008", "venue": "Towards accurate and efficient classification: a discriminative and frequent pattern-based approach", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["Jiawei Han", "Hong Cheng"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a7ffc60b4bee2de99d07"}}, {"index": "5390a17720f70186a0e52430", "title": "Knowledge transfer via multiple model local structure mapping", "abstract": "The effectiveness of knowledge transfer using classification algorithms depends on the difference between the distribution that generates the training examples and the one from which test examples are to be drawn. The task can be especially difficult when the training examples are from one or several domains different from the test domain. In this paper, we propose a locally weighted ensemble framework to combine multiple models for transfer learning, where the weights are dynamically assigned according to a model's predictive power on each test example. It can integrate the advantages of various learning algorithms and the labeled information from multiple training domains into one unified classification model, which can then be applied on a different domain. Importantly, different from many previously proposed methods, none of the base learning method is required to be specifically designed for transfer learning. We show the optimality of a locally weighted ensemble framework as a general approach to combine multiple models for domain transfer. We then propose an implementation of the local weight assignments by mapping the structures of a model onto the structures of the test domain, and then weighting each model locally according to its consistency with the neighborhood structure around the test example. Experimental results on text classification, spam filtering and intrusion detection data sets demonstrate significant improvements in classification accuracy gained by the framework. On a transfer learning task of newsgroup message categorization, the proposed locally weighted ensemble framework achieves 97% accuracy when the best single model predicts correctly only on 73% of the test examples. In summary, the improvement in accuracy is over 10% and up to 30% across different problems.", "year": "2008", "venue": "Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390a40520f70186a0e6e573", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e7500a", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e7504f", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82e40", "5390a72220f70186a0e89666", "5390a72220f70186a0e89688", "5390a72220f70186a0e89661", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba8ca", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe402", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecac93", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda0c0", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda96d", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda973", "5390b13020f70186a0edd701", "5390b5ed20f70186a0f0e1b6", "5390b60d20f70186a0f12855", "5390b61e20f70186a0f14fc7", "5390b7fe20f70186a0f27256", "5390b9d520f70186a0f31eca", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40b73", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40bba", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40efa", "5390bded20f70186a0f48d21", "5390bed320f70186a0f4da09", "558b04ee612c41e6b9d407f2", "558b4362612c41e6b9d47998", "558b139f612c41e6b9d42458", "558af6bc612c41e6b9d3ecae", "558bd7010cf23f2dfc594104"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe0e", "5390979920f70186a0e006a4", "53909f2d20f70186a0e37e6b", "53909f2d20f70186a0e37e79", "53909f2d20f70186a0e394fd", "5390a01420f70186a0e470f1", "539087dd20f70186a0d64ca8", "539087e120f70186a0d6664e", "539087ef20f70186a0d6e61e", "539089ab20f70186a0d9630a", "5390958a20f70186a0df05cf", "5390a1e620f70186a0e5ac1f", "5390a6b120f70186a0e843f1", "5390a6b120f70186a0e84fe6"], "authors": ["Jing Gao", "Wei Fan", "Jing Jiang", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a800c60b4bee2de9a9fc"}}, {"index": "5390a17720f70186a0e5243c", "title": "Mining preferences from superior and inferior examples", "abstract": "Mining user preferences plays a critical role in many important applications such as customer relationship management (CRM), product and service recommendation, and marketing campaigns.

Recently, more and more graph or networked data sources come into being. There exists a similar need to deploy graph analysis from different perspectives and with multiple granularities. However, traditional OLAP technology cannot handle such demands because it does not consider the links among individual data tuples. In this paper, we develop a novel graph OLAP framework, which presents a multi-dimensional and multi-level view over graphs. The contributions of this work are two-fold. First, starting from basic definitions, i.e., what are dimensions and measures in the graph OLAP scenario, we develop a conceptual framework for data cubes on graphs. We also look into different semantics of OLAP operations, and classify the framework into two major subcases: informational OLAP and topological OLAP. Then, with more emphasis on informational OLAP (topological OLAP will be covered in a future study due to the lack of space), we show how a graph cube can be materialized by calculating a special kind of measure called aggregated graph and how to implement it efficiently. This includes both full materialization and partial materialization where constraints are enforced to obtain an iceberg cube. We can see that the aggregated graphs, which depend on the graph properties of underlying networks, are much harder to compute than their traditional OLAP counterparts, due to the increased structural complexity of data.

Both algorithms scale linearly in execution time as the number of sequences grows, making them effective methods for sequential pattern mining in data streams.

Recently, there were studies on integrating these two approaches to support soft queries, based on a user's sense of relevance and preference, for ranking with numerical attributes. However, in real life, it is desirable to use categorical attributes together with numerical ones in ranking. For example, when buying a car, categorical attributes, such as make, model, color, and equipments, are considered as significant factors as numerical attributes, such as price and year. Meanwhile, users often do not have sufficient domain knowledge at formulating an effective selection query over categories, whereas rank formulation is even more challenging as categories have no inherent ordering. In this paper, we propose a framework PerRank (Personalized Ranking with Categorical and Numerical Attributes) to support personalized ranking with both categorical and numerical attributes for soft queries. For an efficient computation, we developed an algorithm CAC (Clustering-based Attribute Construction) which makes use of a clustering method. Extensive experiments show CAC is effective and efficient at supporting ranking with both categorical and numerical attributes for soft queries.", "year": "2008", "venue": "WAIM '08 Proceedings of the 2008 The Ninth International Conference on Web-Age Information Management", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["Sangkyum Kim", "Jaebum Kim", "Younhee Ko", "Seung-won Hwang", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a856c60b4bee2dee0e59"}}, {"index": "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d5c4", "title": "TraClass: trajectory classification using hierarchical region-based and trajectory-based clustering", "abstract": "Trajectory classification, i.e., model construction for predicting the class labels of moving objects based on their trajectories and other features, has many important, real-world applications. A number of methods have been reported in the literature, but due to using the shapes of whole trajectories for classification, they have limited classification capability when discriminative features appear at parts of trajectories or are not relevant to the shapes of trajectories. These situations are often observed in long trajectories spreading over large geographic areas. Since an essential task for effective classification is generating discriminative features, a feature generation framework TraClass for trajectory data is proposed in this paper, which generates a hierarchy of features by partitioning trajectories and exploring two types of clustering: (1) region-based and (2) trajectory-based. The former captures the higher-level region-based features without using movement patterns, whereas the latter captures the lower-level trajectory-based features using movement patterns. The proposed framework overcomes the limitations of the previous studies because trajectory partitioning makes discriminative parts of trajectories identifiable, and the two types of clustering collaborate to find features of both regions and sub-trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that TraClass generates high-quality features and achieves high classification accuracy from real trajectory data.", "year": "2008", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "citations": ["5390a55520f70186a0e79cc9", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82e10", "5390a72220f70186a0e8af19", "5390a7f520f70186a0e938c3", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea04d9", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebd24e", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe144", "5390b04120f70186a0ed8620", "5390b13020f70186a0edd34d", "5390b19020f70186a0edf32e", "5390b29820f70186a0eea5ca", "5390b48420f70186a0efc47b", "5390b4c420f70186a0efed73", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0baa5", "5390b61e20f70186a0f14bcf", "5390b72d20f70186a0f204df", "5390b78a20f70186a0f237dd", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f32bd8", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f3391a", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f33b6b", "5390baa120f70186a0f383ed", "5390baa120f70186a0f388fb", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c31c", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f3ff0c", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f412dd", "5390bd1520f70186a0f43505", "5390bda020f70186a0f479f4", "5390bded20f70186a0f482d8", "5390bf1320f70186a0f503ec", "5390bf1320f70186a0f51d93", "558ad80d612c41e6b9d3b652", "558b1ec1612c41e6b9d43f43", "558b9241612c6b62e5e8bcc7", "558ae2b3612c41e6b9d3c599", "559256200cf2aff368683c46"], "references": ["5390985e20f70186a0e09113", "539099a220f70186a0e1844f", "539099b320f70186a0e19a60", "53909ee020f70186a0e31e6f", "539087cf20f70186a0d5b2f2", "53908a7420f70186a0da45e7", "53908bde20f70186a0dc74e4", "5390a45620f70186a0e72a51", "5390aefc20f70186a0ece0ac", "5390b64020f70186a0f19def"], "authors": ["Jae-Gil Lee", "Jiawei Han", "Xiaolei Li", "Hector Gonzalez"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a86fc60b4bee2def6b9f"}}, {"index": "5390a2e920f70186a0e68700", "title": "Next Generation of Data Mining", "abstract": "Drawn from the US National Science Foundations Symposium on Next Generation of Data Mining and Cyber-Enabled Discovery for Innovation (NGDM 07), Next Generation of Data Mining explores emerging technologies and applications in data mining as well as potential challenges faced by the field.

This paper presents a novel technique for learning a sparse projection over graphs. The data in the reduced subspace is represented as a linear combination of a subset of the most relevant features. Comparing to PCA and LDA, the results obtained by sparse projection are often easier to be interpreted. Our algorithm is based on a graph embedding model, which encodes the discriminating and geometrical structure in terms of the data affinity. Once the embedding results are obtained, we then apply regularized regression for learning a set of sparse basis functions.

In order to leverage their testing efforts, failure reporting components have been widely deployed in released software. Many utilities of the collected failure data depend on an effective failure indexing technique, which, at the optimal case, would index all failures due to the same bug together. Unfortunately, the problem of failure proximity, which underpins the effectiveness of an indexing technique, has not been systematically studied. This article presents the first systematic study of failure proximity. A failure proximity consists of two components: a fingerprinting function that extracts signatures from failures, and a distance function that calculates the likelihood of two failures being due to the same bug. By considering different instantiations of the two functions, we study an array of six failure proximities (two of them are new) in this article. These proximities range from the simplest approach that checks failure points to the most sophisticated approach that utilizes fault localization algorithms to extract failure signatures. Besides presenting technical details of each proximity, we also study the properties of each proximity and tradeoffs between proximities. These altogether deliver a systematic view of failure proximity.", "year": "2008", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering", "citations": ["5390b4c420f70186a0eff10b", "5390b4c420f70186a0eff157", "5390b71120f70186a0f1dafe", "5390b71120f70186a0f1db46"], "references": [], "authors": ["Chao Liu", "Xiangyu Zhang", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a8bac60b4bee2df35e57"}}, {"index": "5390a17720f70186a0e51c15", "title": "Truth Discovery with Multiple Conflicting Information Providers on the Web", "abstract": "The world-wide web has become the most important information source for most of us.

Automatically classifying web objects into manageable semantic categories has long been a fundamental preprocess for indexing, browsing, searching, and mining these objects. The explosive growth of heterogeneous web objects, especially non-textual objects such as products, pictures, and videos, has made the problem of web classification increasingly challenging. Such objects often suffer from a lack of easy-extractable features with semantic information, interconnections between each other, as well as training examples with category labels. In this paper, we explore the social tagging data to bridge this gap. We cast web object classification problem as an optimization problem on a graph of objects and tags.

These methods use information contained in the eigenvectors of a data affinity (i.e., item-item similarity) matrix to reveal the low dimensional structure in the high dimensional data. The most popular manifold learning algorithms include Locally Linear Embedding, ISOMAP, and Laplacian Eigenmap. However, these algorithms only provide the embedding results of training samples. There are many extensions of these approaches which try to solve the out-of-sample extension problem by seeking an embedding function in reproducing kernel Hilbert space. However, a disadvantage of all these approaches is that their computations usually involve eigen-decomposition of dense matrices which is expensive in both time and memory. In this thesis, we introduce a novel dimensionality reduction framework, called Spectral Regression (SR). SR casts the problem of learning an embedding function into a regression framework, which avoids eigen-decomposition of dense matrices. Also, with the regression as a building block, different kinds of regularizers can be naturally incorporated into our framework which makes it more flexible. SR can be performed in supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised situation. It can make efficient use of both labeled and unlabeled points to discover the intrinsic discriminant structure in the data.

Based on these methods, an algorithm called TD-Close is designed for mining a complete set of frequent closed patterns. To enhance its performance further, we improve it by using new pruning strategies and new data structures that lead to a new algorithm TTD-Close. Our performance study shows that the top-down strategy is effective in cutting down search space and saving memory space, while the trace-based method facilitates the closeness-checking.

However, to effectively and comprehensively measure \"how similar two entities are within an information network\" is nontrivial, and the problem becomes even more challenging when the information network to be examined is massive and diverse. In this paper, we propose a new similarity measure, P-Rank (Penetrating Rank), toward effectively computing the structural similarities of entities in real information networks. P-Rank enriches the well-known similarity measure, SimRank, by jointly encoding both in- and out-link relationships into structural similarity computation. P-Rank is proven to be a unified structural similarity framework, under which all state-of-the-art similarity measures, including CoCitation, Coupling, Amsler and SimRank, are just its special cases. Based on its recursive nature of P-Rank, we propose a fixed point algorithm to reinforce structural similarity of vertex pairs beyond the localized neighborhood scope toward the entire information network. Our experimental studies demonstrate the power of P-Rank as an effective similarity measure in different information networks. Meanwhile, under the same time/space complexity, P-Rank outperforms SimRank as a comprehensive and more meaningful structural similarity measure, especially in large real information networks.", "year": "2009", "venue": "Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management", "citations": ["5390a9a420f70186a0ea49b3", "5390ac1720f70186a0eb278a", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebd0a5", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec67d6", "5390af8920f70186a0ecfeb1", "5390af8920f70186a0ecfff0", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5e7a", "5390b0ca20f70186a0ed9c94", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda999", "5390b13020f70186a0eddd9f", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3fa0", "5390b20120f70186a0ee406e", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef5b23", "5390b44620f70186a0ef89e0", "5390b48420f70186a0efbf62", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0b384", "5390b71120f70186a0f1fce3", "5390b72e20f70186a0f20961", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a67b", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2b3c1", "5390ba3820f70186a0f36aef", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3df32", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f412f3", "5390bd1520f70186a0f433ed", "5390bd1520f70186a0f44337", "558b4ada612c41e6b9d485dd", "5390be6620f70186a0f4c864", "5390bfa220f70186a0f542d6", "558afd58612c41e6b9d3fc51", "558aee34612c41e6b9d3da81", "558aec10612c41e6b9d3d91a", "55323b8245cec66b6f9da110", "55323bbd45cec66b6f9da7d2"], "references": ["5390981d20f70186a0e04576", "5390981d20f70186a0e05a27", "5390985e20f70186a0e08e59", "5390995d20f70186a0e15cac", "539099ec20f70186a0e1cb26", "53909e7c20f70186a0e2a801", "53909ee020f70186a0e32382", "53909f8220f70186a0e3ca15", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401bc", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d58f", "5390a63d20f70186a0e836d3", "539087ef20f70186a0d6e1ac", "539087fe20f70186a0d73a8b", "539087fe20f70186a0d75e22", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc410", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbe2df", "5390b29820f70186a0ee97b9"], "authors": ["Peixiang Zhao", "Jiawei Han", "Yizhou Sun"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a558c60b4bede9e9008b"}}, {"index": "5390a45620f70186a0e72bc5", "title": "Temporal Outlier Detection in Vehicle Traffic Data", "abstract": "Outlier detection in vehicle traffic data is a practical problem that has gained traction lately due to an increasing capability to track moving vehicles in city roads.

Given a database of sequences where each sequence is an ordered list of events, the pattern we would like to mine is called repetitive gapped subsequence, which is a subsequence (possibly with gaps between two successive events within it) of some sequences in the database. We introduce the concept of repetitive support to measure how frequently a pattern repeats in the database.

Automatically classifying web objects into manageable semantic categories has long been a fundamental preprocess for indexing, browsing, searching, and mining these objects. The explosive growth of heterogeneous web objects, especially non-textual objects such as products, pictures, and videos, has made the problem of web classification increasingly challenging. Such objects often suffer from a lack of easy-extractable features with semantic information, interconnections between each other, as well as training examples with category labels. In this paper, we explore the social tagging data to bridge this gap. We cast web object classification problem as an optimization problem on a graph of objects and tags. We then propose an efficient algorithm which not only utilizes social tags as enriched semantic features for the objects, but also infers the categories of unlabeled objects from both homogeneous and heterogeneous labeled objects, through the implicit connection of social tags.

These methods use information contained in the eigenvectors of a data affinity (i.e., item-item similarity) matrix to reveal the low dimensional structure in the high dimensional data. The most popular manifold learning algorithms include Locally Linear Embedding, ISOMAP, and Laplacian Eigenmap. However, these algorithms only provide the embedding results of training samples. There are many extensions of these approaches which try to solve the out-of-sample extension problem by seeking an embedding function in reproducing kernel Hilbert space. However, a disadvantage of all these approaches is that their computations usually involve eigen-decomposition of dense matrices which is expensive in both time and memory. In this thesis, we introduce a novel dimensionality reduction framework, called Spectral Regression (SR). SR casts the problem of learning an embedding function into a regression framework, which avoids eigen-decomposition of dense matrices. Also, with the regression as a building block, different kinds of regularizers can be naturally incorporated into our framework which makes it more flexible. SR can be performed in supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised situation. It can make efficient use of both labeled and unlabeled points to discover the intrinsic discriminant structure in the data.

However, to effectively and comprehensively measure \"how similar two entities are within an information network\" is nontrivial, and the problem becomes even more challenging when the information network to be examined is massive and diverse. In this paper, we propose a new similarity measure, P-Rank (Penetrating Rank), toward effectively computing the structural similarities of entities in real information networks. P-Rank enriches the well-known similarity measure, SimRank, by jointly encoding both in- and out-link relationships into structural similarity computation. P-Rank is proven to be a unified structural similarity framework, under which all state-of-the-art similarity measures, including CoCitation, Coupling, Amsler and SimRank, are just its special cases. Based on its recursive nature of P-Rank, we propose a fixed point algorithm to reinforce structural similarity of vertex pairs beyond the localized neighborhood scope toward the entire information network. Our experimental studies demonstrate the power of P-Rank as an effective similarity measure in different information networks. Meanwhile, under the same time/space complexity, P-Rank outperforms SimRank as a comprehensive and more meaningful structural similarity measure, especially in large real information networks.", "year": "2009", "venue": "Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management", "citations": ["5390a9a420f70186a0ea49b3", "5390ac1720f70186a0eb278a", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebd0a5", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec67d6", "5390af8920f70186a0ecfeb1", "5390af8920f70186a0ecfff0", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5e7a", "5390b0ca20f70186a0ed9c94", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda999", "5390b13020f70186a0eddd9f", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3fa0", "5390b20120f70186a0ee406e", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef5b23", "5390b44620f70186a0ef89e0", "5390b48420f70186a0efbf62", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0b384", "5390b71120f70186a0f1fce3", "5390b72e20f70186a0f20961", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a67b", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2b3c1", "5390ba3820f70186a0f36aef", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3df32", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f412f3", "5390bd1520f70186a0f433ed", "5390bd1520f70186a0f44337", "558b4ada612c41e6b9d485dd", "5390be6620f70186a0f4c864", "5390bfa220f70186a0f542d6", "558afd58612c41e6b9d3fc51", "558aee34612c41e6b9d3da81", "558aec10612c41e6b9d3d91a", "55323b8245cec66b6f9da110", "55323bbd45cec66b6f9da7d2"], "references": ["5390981d20f70186a0e04576", "5390981d20f70186a0e05a27", "5390985e20f70186a0e08e59", "5390995d20f70186a0e15cac", "539099ec20f70186a0e1cb26", "53909e7c20f70186a0e2a801", "53909ee020f70186a0e32382", "53909f8220f70186a0e3ca15", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401bc", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d58f", "5390a63d20f70186a0e836d3", "539087ef20f70186a0d6e1ac", "539087fe20f70186a0d73a8b", "539087fe20f70186a0d75e22", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc410", "53908b6c20f70186a0dbe2df", "5390b29820f70186a0ee97b9"], "authors": ["Peixiang Zhao", "Jiawei Han", "Yizhou Sun"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a636c60b4bee2dd4589e"}}, {"index": "5390a45620f70186a0e72bc5", "title": "Temporal Outlier Detection in Vehicle Traffic Data", "abstract": "Outlier detection in vehicle traffic data is a practical problem that has gained traction lately due to an increasing capability to track moving vehicles in city roads.

Given a database of sequences where each sequence is an ordered list of events, the pattern we would like to mine is called repetitive gapped subsequence, which is a subsequence (possibly with gaps between two successive events within it) of some sequences in the database. We introduce the concept of repetitive support to measure how frequently a pattern repeats in the database. Different from the sequential pattern mining problem, repetitive support captures not only repetitions of a pattern in different sequences but also the repetitions within a sequence. Given a userspecified support threshold min_sup, we study finding the set of all patterns with repetitive support no less than min_sup.

For example, to predict the research areas of some people, the best results are usually achieved by combining and consolidating predictions obtained from the publication network, co-authorship network and the textual content of their publications. Multiple supervised and unsupervised hypotheses can be drawn from these information sources, and negotiating their differences and consolidating decisions usually yields a much more accurate model due to the diversity and heterogeneity of these models. In this paper, we address the problem of \"consensus learning\" among competing hypotheses, which either rely on outside knowledge (supervised learning) or internal structure (unsupervised clustering). We argue that consensus learning is an NP-hard problem and thus propose to solve it by an efficient heuristic method. We construct a belief graph to first propagate predictions from supervised models to the unsupervised, and then negotiate and reach consensus among them. Their final decision is further consolidated by calculating each model's weight based on its degree of consistency with other models. Experiments are conducted on 20 Newsgroups data, Cora research papers, DBLP author-conference network, and Yahoo! Movies datasets, and the results show that the proposed method improves the classification accuracy and the clustering quality measure (NMI) over the best base model by up to 10%.

To genetically improve root structure in the future, there is a need to identify the genes that govern root complexity. Root complexity itself is ill defined, but indicators derived from images of the root system such as Fractal Dimension can be used as proxies. A disadvantage of using Fractal Dimension as a complexity indicator is that the complexity of the root as seen in the images is captured into a single parameter. This paper describes an alternative method, which translates a root image into a set of parameters. The method consists of computing the intercepts of circles drawn around the centre of the root image with the root branches. This led to characteristic curves from which parameters can be extracted using curve fitting. In addition to the parameters obtained by curve fitting, the density of the root images was included. All parameters were evaluated on their ability to classify the roots among their original genotypes using a method from the realm of Artificial Intelligence, the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results showed that whilst using merely three parameters originating from the characteristic curves, the SVM algorithm was capable of correctly classifying 99.95% of roots among 235 original genotypes.", "year": "2009", "venue": "Computers and Electronics in Agriculture", "citations": [], "references": ["539098dc20f70186a0e0c74a", "539087cf20f70186a0d5b2f2", "539087f820f70186a0d71f50", "539087fe20f70186a0d741b5", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fd2", "539089ab20f70186a0d9633d", "53908b9320f70186a0dc0062"], "authors": ["D.

Responding to this emerging trend, graphs have been growing rapidly and showing their critical importance in many applications, such as the analysis of XML, social networks, Web, biological data, multimedia data and spatiotemporal data. Can we extend useful functions of databases and data warehouse systems to handle graph structured data? In particular, OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) has been a popular tool for fast and user-friendly multi-dimensional analysis of data warehouses. Can we OLAP graphs? Unfortunately, to our best knowledge, there are no OLAP tools available that can interactively view and analyze graph data from different perspectives and with multiple granularities. In this paper, we argue that it is critically important to OLAP graph structured data and propose a novel Graph OLAP framework. According to this framework, given a graph dataset with its nodes and edges associated with respective attributes, a multi-dimensional model can be built to enable efficient on-line analytical processing so that any portions of the graphs can be generalized/specialized dynamically, offering multiple, versatile views of the data. The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, starting from basic definitions, i.e., what are dimensions and measures in the Graph OLAP scenario, we develop a conceptual framework for data cubes on graphs. We also look into different semantics of OLAP operations, and classify the framework into two major subcases: informational OLAP and topological OLAP. Second, we show how a graph cube can be materialized by calculating a special kind of measure called aggregated graph and how to implement it efficiently. This includes both full materialization and partial materialization where constraints are enforced to obtain an iceberg cube. As we can see, due to the increased structural complexity of data, aggregated graphs that depend on the underlying \u201cnetwork\u201d properties of the graph dataset are much harder to compute than their traditional OLAP counterparts. Third, to provide more flexible, interesting and informative OLAP of graphs, we further propose a discovery-driven multi-dimensional analysis model to ensure that OLAP is performed in an intelligent manner, guided by expert rules and knowledge discovery processes. We outline such a framework and discuss some challenging research issues for discovery-driven Graph OLAP.", "year": "2009", "venue": "Knowledge and Information Systems", "citations": ["5390b24320f70186a0ee637c", "5390b56a20f70186a0f0677c", "5390b64020f70186a0f19b91", "5390b86b20f70186a0f28b94", "5390bd1520f70186a0f4337f", "5390bd1520f70186a0f44245", "5390bda020f70186a0f465ba", "5390bf1320f70186a0f5125b"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe14", "5390972920f70186a0dfbe59", "539098b820f70186a0e0a843", "539098b820f70186a0e0ad9c", "5390995d20f70186a0e15cac", "53909ce520f70186a0e26ee1", "53909eef20f70186a0e35867", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a080", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401ba", "53909fbd20f70186a0e4208b", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c6f8", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c6ed", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c6ef", "5390a0b720f70186a0e5003f", "5390a17720f70186a0e52441", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6bc28", "5390879520f70186a0d3dd5f", "539087dd20f70186a0d634a2", "539087dd20f70186a0d644a5", "539087e720f70186a0d6964e", "539087f320f70186a0d6f879", "539087f320f70186a0d70cf9", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fba", "539089bb20f70186a0d98883", "53908a4020f70186a0d9f4a7", "53908a7420f70186a0da45d1", "539096cb20f70186a0df7a19"], "authors": ["Chen Chen", "Xifeng Yan", "Feida Zhu", "Jiawei Han", "Philip S.

Discovery of evolutionary communities in dynamic networks has become a critical task. The previous evolutionary clustering methods usually adopt the temporal smoothness framework, which has a desirable feature of controlling the balance between temporal noise and true concept drift of communities. They, however, have some major drawbacks: (1) assuming only a fixed number of communities over time; and (2) not allowing arbitrary start/stop of community over time. The forming of new communities and dissolving of existing communities are very common phenomena in real dynamic networks. In this paper, we propose a new particle-and-density based evolutionary clustering method that efficiently discovers a variable number of communities of arbitrary forming and dissolving. We first model a dynamic network as a collection of lots of particles called nano-communities, and a community as a densely connected subset of particles, called a quasi l-clique-by-clique (shortly, l-KK). Each particle contains a small amount of information about the evolution of data or patterns, and the quasi l-KKs inherent in a given dynamic network provide us with guidance on how to find a variable number of communities of arbitrary forming and dissolving. We propose a density-based clustering method that efficiently finds temporally smoothed local clusters of high quality by using a cost embedding technique and optimal modularity. We also propose a mapping method based on information theory that makes sequences of smoothed local clusters as close as possible to data-inherent quasi l-KKs. The result of the mapping method allows us to easily identify the stage of each community among the three stages: evolving, forming, and dissolving.

Graph pattern mining has become an important tool in the management and analysis of complexly structured data, where example applications include indexing, clustering and classification. Existing graph mining algorithms have achieved great success by exploiting various properties in the pattern space. Unfortunately, due to the fundamental role subgraph isomorphism plays in these methods, they may all enter into a pitfall when the cost to enumerate a huge set of isomorphic embeddings blows up, especially in large graphs. The solution we propose for this problem resorts to reduction on the data space. For each graph, we build a summary of it and mine this shrunk graph instead. Compared to other data reduction techniques that either reduce the number of transactions or compress between transactions, this new framework, called Summarize-Mine, suggests a third path by compressing within transactions. Summarize-Mine is effective in cutting down the size of graphs, thus decreasing the embedding enumeration cost. However, compression might lose patterns at the same time.

It is crucial to discover time-evolving communities in dynamic networks. In this paper, we study the problem of finding time-evolving communities such that each community freely forms, evolves, and dissolves for any time period. Although the previous t -partite graph based methods are quite effective for discovering such communities from large-scale dynamic networks, they have some weak points such as finding only stable clusters of single path type and not being scalable w.r.t. the time period. We propose CHRONICLE , an efficient clustering algorithm that discovers not only clusters of single path type but also clusters of path group type. In order to find clusters of both types and also control the dynamicity of clusters, CHRONICLE performs the two-stage density-based clustering, which performs the 2nd-stage density-based clustering for the t -partite graph constructed from the 1st-stage density-based clustering result for each timestamp network. For a given data set, CHRONICLE finds all clusters in a fixed time by using a fixed amount of memory, regardless of the number of clusters and the length of clusters. Experimental results using real data sets show that CHRONICLE finds a wider range of clusters in a shorter time with a much smaller amount of memory than the previous method.", "year": "2009", "venue": "DS '09 Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Discovery Science", "citations": ["5390b48420f70186a0efa9b9"], "references": ["5390985d20f70186a0e06e81", "5390985e20f70186a0e09113", "539098b820f70186a0e0a845", "539099b320f70186a0e19a41", "53909ee020f70186a0e31e6f", "53909ee020f70186a0e32371", "53909f2d20f70186a0e394f7", "53909f2d20f70186a0e3952d", "53909f2d20f70186a0e39530", "53909f2d20f70186a0e39544", "53909f2d20f70186a0e3953b", "53909fbc20f70186a0e41c34", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4a7a4", "5390a17720f70186a0e5245c"], "authors": ["Min-Soo Kim", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a79ac60b4bee2de547bf"}}, {"index": "5390a80f20f70186a0e96732", "title": "Assured information sharing life cycle", "abstract": "This paper describes our approach to assured information sharing.

Our technique first mines a set of discriminative features capturing repetitive series of events from program execution traces. It then performs feature selection to select the best features for classification. These features are then used to train a classifier to detect failures.

Often multiple seemingly different event patterns lead to the same type of failure manifestation. A hidden relationship exists, in those patterns, among event attributes that is somehow responsible for the failure. For example, in some system, a message might always get corrupted if the sender is more than two hops away from the receiver (which is a distance relationship) irrespective of the senderId and receiverId. To uncover such failure-causing relationships, we present a new symbolic pattern extraction technique that identifies and symbolically expresses relationships correlated with anomalous behavior. Symbolic pattern extraction is a new concept in sensor network debugging that is unique in its ability to generalize over patterns that involve different combinations of nodes or message exchanges by extracting their common relationship. As a proof of concept, we provide synthetic traffic scenarios where we show that applying symbolic pattern extraction can uncover more complex bug patterns that are crucial to the understanding of real causes of problems. We also use symbolic pattern extraction to diagnose a real bug and show that it generates much fewer and more accurate patterns compared to previous approaches.", "year": "2009", "venue": "DCOSS '09 Proceedings of the 5th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems", "citations": ["5390bda020f70186a0f46ff3"], "references": ["539098b820f70186a0e09cbc", "539098b820f70186a0e0a7c6", "539098dd20f70186a0e0e2fc", "5390995d20f70186a0e14b40", "5390995d20f70186a0e14b3e", "539099a220f70186a0e190d7", "53909a9320f70186a0e21e22", "53909a9320f70186a0e22c1a", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2e4d1", "53909ee020f70186a0e31e1c", "53909ee020f70186a0e32280", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40f87", "5390a1d420f70186a0e5745d", "5390a25820f70186a0e5efb4", "5390a25820f70186a0e5efb5", "5390a25820f70186a0e5efb3", "53908a9620f70186a0da4bb0", "5390958920f70186a0deebd5", "539095ba20f70186a0df0d89", "5390a96f20f70186a0ea3c42"], "authors": ["Mohammad Maifi Khan", "Tarek Abdelzaher", "Jiawei Han", "Hossein Ahmadi"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a847c60b4bee2ded43b1"}}, {"index": "5390a7f520f70186a0e93556", "title": "Mining Heterogeneous Information Networks by Exploring the Power of Links", "abstract": "Knowledge is power but for interrelated data, knowledge is often hidden in massive links in heterogeneous information networks.

Both ranking and clustering can provide overall views on information network data, and each has been a hot topic by itself. However, ranking objects globally without considering which clusters they belong to often leads to dumb results, e.g., ranking database and computer architecture conferences together may not make much sense. Similarly, clustering a huge number of objects (e.g., thousands of authors) in one huge cluster without distinction is dull as well. In this paper, we address the problem of generating clusters for a specified type of objects, as well as ranking information for all types of objects based on these clusters in a multi-typed (i.e., heterogeneous) information network. A novel clustering framework called RankClus is proposed that directly generates clusters integrated with ranking. Based on initial K clusters, ranking is applied separately, which serves as a good measure for each cluster. Then, we use a mixture model to decompose each object into a K-dimensional vector, where each dimension is a component coefficient with respect to a cluster, which is measured by rank distribution. Objects then are reassigned to the nearest cluster under the new measure space to improve clustering. As a result, quality of clustering and ranking are mutually enhanced, which means that the clusters are getting more accurate and the ranking is getting more meaningful.

On the bottom layer, we follow the traditional topic model to model the generation of text for each document. A joint distribution function for both the text and structure of the documents is thus provided. A solution to estimate this topic model is given, by maximizing the log-likelihood of the joint probability. Some important practical issues in real applications are also discussed, including how to decide the topic number and how to choose a good network structure.

Although online analytical processing (OLAP) techniques have been proven very useful for analyzing and mining structured data, they face challenges in handling text data. On the other hand, probabilistic topic models are among the most effective approaches to latent topic analysis and mining on text data. In this paper, we study a new data model called topic cube to combine OLAP with probabilistic topic modeling and enable OLAP on the dimension of text data in a multidimensional text database. Topic cube extends the traditional data cube to cope with a topic hierarchy and stores probabilistic content measures of text documents learned through a probabilistic topic model. To materialize topic cubes efficiently, we propose two heuristic aggregations to speed up the iterative Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating topic models by leveraging the models learned on component data cells to choose a good starting point for iteration. Experimental results show that these heuristic aggregations are much faster than the baseline method of computing each topic cube from scratch. We also discuss some potential uses of topic cube and show sample experimental results. Copyright \u00a9 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Clustering on such a network may lead to better understanding of both hidden structures of the network and the individual role played by every object in each cluster. However, although clustering on homogeneous networks has been studied over decades, clustering on heterogeneous networks has not been addressed until recently. A recent study proposed a new algorithm, RankClus, for clustering on bi-typed heterogeneous networks. However, a real-world network may consist of more than two types, and the interactions among multi-typed objects play a key role at disclosing the rich semantics that a network carries. In this paper, we study clustering of multi-typed heterogeneous networks with a star network schema and propose a novel algorithm, NetClus, that utilizes links across multityped objects to generate high-quality net-clusters. An iterative enhancement method is developed that leads to effective ranking-based clustering in such heterogeneous networks. Our experiments on DBLP data show that NetClus generates more accurate clustering results than the baseline topic model algorithm PLSA and the recently proposed algorithm, RankClus. Further, NetClus generates informative clusters, presenting good ranking and cluster membership information for each attribute object in each net-cluster.", "year": "2009", "venue": "Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390a79f20f70186a0e922e2", "5390a7f520f70186a0e93556", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab8ad", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb1228", "5390ac1720f70186a0eb2873", "5390aca920f70186a0eb9c1d", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba8ba", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebdf38", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed456a", "5390b04120f70186a0ed86fa", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda98b", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda9c3", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda9c0", "5390b13020f70186a0edc02f", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3f87", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef4965", "5390b4c320f70186a0efd445", "5390b4c320f70186a0efe2e3", "5390b4c420f70186a0efeced", "5390b5c620f70186a0f08df1", "5390b61e20f70186a0f14c56", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e250", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e257", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e25d", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e2e0", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e2f5", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e30a", "5390b78a20f70186a0f23ecd", "5390b95520f70186a0f2f679", "5390ba3820f70186a0f36913", "5390baa120f70186a0f37f02", "5390bae520f70186a0f3bbbd", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d0d8", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3df1f", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3df2a", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f3fb81", "5390bd1520f70186a0f432a6", "5390bda020f70186a0f45fe3", "5390bda020f70186a0f46ff2", "5390bded20f70186a0f48ef9", "5390be6620f70186a0f4c2b3", "5390be6620f70186a0f4c2b6", "5390be6620f70186a0f4c2d8", "5390bed320f70186a0f4e6cd", "5390bf1320f70186a0f51b0e", "558b26a0612c41e6b9d44e8e", "558ad324612c41e6b9d3afa7", "558b09b6612c41e6b9d41089", "558b2dd0612c41e6b9d45cc6", "558aec10612c41e6b9d3d91a", "559252380cf28b1a968ffb2b", "558c15b40cf2e30013db5219", "55323b7445cec66b6f9d9ef0", "559143540cf232eb904fb819"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe5d", "5390972920f70186a0dfbe20", "5390981d20f70186a0e05a1f", "5390990f20f70186a0e0f1d2", "539099a220f70186a0e18417", "53909f2d20f70186a0e3953b", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c6f8", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c6ef", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4f45c", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6bc28", "539087ef20f70186a0d6e1ac", "539087f820f70186a0d71f36", "539087fe20f70186a0d73a8b", "53908a5820f70186a0da128e", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc410", "53908b9320f70186a0dc0085", "539096cb20f70186a0df6d63", "5390b24320f70186a0ee615f"], "authors": ["Yizhou Sun", "Yintao Yu", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a89ac60b4bee2df1c1dd"}}, {"index": "5390a77d20f70186a0e8fe4d", "title": "Mining Personal Image Collection for Social Group Suggestion", "abstract": "Popular photo-sharing sites have attracted millions of people and helped construct massive social networks in cyberspace.

This paradigm has attracted the attention of researchers that wish to study the corresponding social and technological problems. Link recommendation is a critical task that not only helps increase the linkage inside the network and also improves the user experience. In an effective link recommendation algorithm it is essential to identify the factors that influence link creation. This paper enumerates several of these intuitive criteria and proposes an approach which satisfies these factors.

A good example is a web-blogging community with the daily blog posts and a social network of bloggers. An important task of analyzing an online community is to observe and track the popular events, or topics that evolve over time in the community. Existing approaches usually focus on either the burstiness of topics or the evolution of networks, but ignoring the interplay between textual topics and network structures. In this paper, we formally define the problem of popular event tracking in online communities (PET), focusing on the interplay between texts and networks. We propose a novel statistical method that models the the popularity of events over time, taking into consideration the burstiness of user interest, information diffusion on the network structure, and the evolution of textual topics. Specifically, a Gibbs Random Field is defined to model the influence of historic status and the dependency relationships in the graph; thereafter a topic model generates the words in text content of the event, regularized by the Gibbs Random Field. We prove that two classic models in information diffusion and text burstiness are special cases of our model under certain situations.

In these datasets (called \"information networks\"), closely related objects that share the same properties or interests form a community. For example, a community in blogsphere could be users mostly interested in cell phone reviews and news. Outlier detection in information networks can reveal important anomalous and interesting behaviors that are not obvious if community information is ignored. An example could be a low-income person being friends with many rich people even though his income is not anomalously low when considered over the entire population. This paper first introduces the concept of community outliers (interesting points or rising stars for a more positive sense), and then shows that well-known baseline approaches without considering links or community information cannot find these community outliers. We propose an efficient solution by modeling networked data as a mixture model composed of multiple normal communities and a set of randomly generated outliers. The probabilistic model characterizes both data and links simultaneously by defining their joint distribution based on hidden Markov random fields (HMRF).

One of the most important aspects of information network analysis is to measure similarity between nodes in a network. SimRank is a simple and influential measure of this kind, based on a solid theoretical \"random surfer\" model. Existing work computes SimRank similarity scores in an iterative mode. We argue that the iterative method can be infeasible and inefficient when, as in many real-world scenarios, the networks change dynamically and frequently. We envision non-iterative method to bridge the gap. It allows users not only to update the similarity scores incrementally, but also to derive similarity scores for an arbitrary subset of nodes. To enable the non-iterative computation, we propose to rewrite the SimRank equation into a non-iterative form by using the Kronecker product and vectorization operators.

At the core of many advanced network operations lies a common and critical graph query primitive: how to search graph structures efficiently within a large network? Unfortunately, the graph query is hard due to the NP-complete nature of subgraph isomorphism. It becomes even challenging when the network examined is large and diverse. In this paper, we present a high performance graph indexing mechanism, SPath, to address the graph query problem on large networks. SPath leverages decomposed shortest paths around vertex neighborhood as basic indexing units, which prove to be both effective in graph search space pruning and highly scalable in index construction and deployment. Via SPath, a graph query is processed and optimized beyond the traditional vertex-at-a-time fashion to a more efficient path-at-a-time way: the query is first decomposed to a set of shortest paths, among which a subset of candidates with good selectivity is picked by a query plan optimizer; Candidate paths are further joined together to help recover the query graph to finalize the graph query processing. We evaluate SPath with the state-of-the-art GraphQL on both real and synthetic data sets. Our experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of SPath, which proves to be a more practical and efficient indexing method in addressing graph queries on large networks.", "year": "2010", "venue": "Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment", "citations": ["5390b00c20f70186a0ed4500", "5390b13020f70186a0edd32e", "5390b13020f70186a0edd32d", "5390b13020f70186a0eddd9d", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3fc9", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3fc6", "5390b36120f70186a0ef16cc", "5390b56a20f70186a0f049fd", "5390b56a20f70186a0f04a37", "5390b5ed20f70186a0f0d969", "5390b63320f70186a0f17d40", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e30a", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a110", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a267", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f34d0e", "5390baa120f70186a0f383f8", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c573", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d0dc", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3df25", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40c31", "5390bded20f70186a0f48354", "5390be6620f70186a0f4c37c", "5390bed320f70186a0f4e6a5", "5390bf1320f70186a0f50446", "558b3132612c41e6b9d463fb", "558b35b4612c41e6b9d46b7c", "558ae372612c41e6b9d3c796", "558b2da2612c41e6b9d45c95", "55323b8745cec66b6f9da13f", "55323bd245cec66b6f9daa79", "55323be745cec66b6f9dad43"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfaca3", "5390975920f70186a0dfccde", "5390980720f70186a0e03a54", "539098b820f70186a0e0ad8a", "5390995d20f70186a0e1526b", "53909e7c20f70186a0e2bebb", "53909ee020f70186a0e31e85", "53909ee020f70186a0e31e84", "53909ee020f70186a0e31e57", "53909fbd20f70186a0e41c3f", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c6ec", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c6fa", "5390a1d420f70186a0e58ba1", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d58b", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6bc08", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75a03", "5390a79f20f70186a0e9233b", "5390a7f520f70186a0e93a79", "539087f920f70186a0d7335b", "5390882420f70186a0d89094", "539088b820f70186a0d905c0", "5390893e20f70186a0d9235e", "53908cde20f70186a0dcd9a3", "53908dff20f70186a0dd3f06", "5390958920f70186a0deec72"], "authors": ["Peixiang Zhao", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a6e0c60b4bee2ddcabd0"}}, {"index": "5390aaf920f70186a0ead46e", "title": "DisIClass: discriminative frequent pattern-based image classification", "abstract": "Owing to the rapid mounting of massive image data, image classification has attracted lots of research efforts.

Based on B2S, we construct two different image classification approaches. First, we apply B2S to a state-of-the-art image classification algorithm SPM in computer vision. Second, we design a framework DisIClass (Discriminative Frequent Pattern-Based Image Classification) to utilize data mining algorithms to classify images, which was hardly done before due to the intrinsic differences between the data of computer vision and data mining fields. DisIClass adapts the locality property of image data, and apply sequential covering method to induce the most discriminative feature sets from a closed frequent item set mining method.

In classification settings, one is often interested in discovering discriminative frequent subgraphs, whose presence or absence is indicative of the class membership of a graph. In this article, we propose an approach to feature selection on frequent subgraphs, called CORK, that combines two central advantages. First, it optimizes a submodular quality criterion, which means that we can yield a near-optimal solution using greedy feature selection. Second, our submodular quality function criterion can be integrated into gSpan, the state-of-the-art tool for frequent subgraph mining, and help to prune the search space for discriminative frequent subgraphs even during frequent subgraph mining.

These algorithms assume that feature values of the mined patterns are binary, i.e., a pattern either exists or not. In some problems, however, the number of times a pattern appears is more informative than whether a pattern appears or not. To resolve these deficiencies, we propose a mathematical programming method that directly mines discriminative patterns as numerical features for classification. We also propose a novel search space shrinking technique which addresses the inefficiencies in iterative pattern mining algorithms. Finally, we show that our method is an order of magnitude faster, significantly more memory efficient and more accurate than current approaches.", "year": "2010", "venue": "ECML PKDD'10 Proceedings of the 2010 European conference on Machine learning and knowledge discovery in databases: Part II", "citations": ["5390b04120f70186a0ed86ae", "5390b4c420f70186a0efe632", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0ba88", "5390b78a20f70186a0f243cf", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40063", "5390bda020f70186a0f45fc5", "5390bda020f70186a0f46ff3"], "references": ["5390979920f70186a0e00fee", "5390a17720f70186a0e5242a", "5390a17720f70186a0e52451", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6c4b3", "5390a45620f70186a0e72a5c", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75020", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75047", "539087e120f70186a0d661ee", "5390881820f70186a0d8115c", "539089ab20f70186a0d9632e", "53908a5820f70186a0da11ce", "53908a9620f70186a0da5486", "5390958a20f70186a0df05d8", "5390aefc20f70186a0ece0ac"], "authors": ["Hyungsul Kim", "Sangkyum Kim", "Tim Weninger", "Jiawei Han", "Tarek Abdelzaher"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a73bc60b4bee2de0bc9e"}}, {"index": "5390ad5620f70186a0ebdf38", "title": "Graph regularized transductive classification on heterogeneous information networks", "abstract": "A heterogeneous information network is a network composed of multiple types of objects and links. Recently, it has been recognized that strongly-typed heterogeneous information networks are prevalent in the real world. Sometimes, label information is available for some objects. Learning from such labeled and unlabeled data via transductive classification can lead to good knowledge extraction of the hidden network structure. However, although classification on homogeneous networks has been studied for decades, classification on heterogeneous networks has not been explored until recently. In this paper, we consider the transductive classification problem on heterogeneous networked data which share a common topic. Only some objects in the given network are labeled, and we aim to predict labels for all types of the remaining objects. A novel graph-based regularization framework, GNetMine, is proposed to model the link structure in information networks with arbitrary network schema and arbitrary number of object/link types. Specifically, we explicitly respect the type differences by preserving consistency over each relation graph corresponding to each type of links separately. Efficient computational schemes are then introduced to solve the corresponding optimization problem.

Due to their sequential nature, trajectory data are often received incrementally, e.g., continuous new points reported by GPS system. However, since existing trajectory clustering algorithms are developed for static datasets, they are not suitable for incremental clustering with the following two requirements. First, clustering should be processed efficiently since it can be frequently requested. Second, huge amounts of trajectory data must be accommodated, as they will accumulate constantly. An incremental clustering framework for trajectories is proposed in this paper. It contains two parts: online micro-cluster maintenance and offline macro-cluster creation. For online part, when a new bunch of trajectories arrives, each trajectory is simplified into a set of directed line segments in order to find clusters of trajectory subparts. Micro-clusters are used to store compact summaries of similar trajectory line segments, which take much smaller space than raw trajectories. When new data are added, micro-clusters are updated incrementally to reflect the changes. For offline part, when a user requests to see current clustering result, macro-clustering is performed on the set of micro-clusters rather than on all trajectories over the whole time span. Since the number of micro-clusters is smaller than that of original trajectories, macro-clusters are generated efficiently to show clustering result of trajectories. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets show that our framework achieves high efficiency as well as high clustering quality.", "year": "2010", "venue": "DASFAA'10 Proceedings of the 15th international conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications - Volume Part II", "citations": ["5390b13020f70186a0edd34d", "5390b5c620f70186a0f090a0", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2bc0c", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f33b6b", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f33b7f", "5390baa120f70186a0f38b69", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f3ff0c", "5390bf1320f70186a0f51d93"], "references": ["53909ee020f70186a0e31e6f", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe2a", "5390a01420f70186a0e47782", "539087d920f70186a0d5ff7a", "539087f320f70186a0d6f85f", "539087f820f70186a0d711dd", "5390880720f70186a0d7876d", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2ea", "53908a7420f70186a0da4548"], "authors": ["Zhenhui Li", "Jae-Gil Lee", "Xiaolei Li", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a740c60b4bee2de0f801"}}, {"index": "5390ad0620f70186a0eba8ba", "title": "Mining topic-level influence in heterogeneous networks", "abstract": "Influence is a complex and subtle force that governs the dynamics of social networks as well as the behaviors of involved users. Understanding influence can benefit various applications such as viral marketing, recommendation, and information retrieval.

Few works systematically investigate how to mine the strength of direct and indirect influence between nodes in heterogeneous networks. To address the problem, we propose a generative graphical model which utilizes the heterogeneous link information and the textual content associated with each node in the network to mine topic-level direct influence. Based on the learned direct influence, a topic-level influence propagation and aggregation algorithm is proposed to derive the indirect influence between nodes. We further study how the discovered topic-level influence can help the prediction of user behaviors. We validate the approach on three different genres of data sets: Twitter, Digg, and citation networks. Qualitatively, our approach can discover interesting influence patterns in heterogeneous networks.

Generally, there are several different kinds of nodes in a network which are cluster nodes densely connected within communities, as well as some special nodes like hubs bridging multiple communities and outliers marginally connected with a community. In addition, it has been shown that there is a hierarchical structure in complex networks with communities embedded within other communities. Therefore, a good algorithm is desirable to be able to not only detect hierarchical communities, but also identify hubs and outliers. In this paper, we propose a parameter-free hierarchical network clustering algorithm SHRINK by combining the advantages of density-based clustering and modularity optimization methods. Based on the structural connectivity information, the proposed algorithm can effectively reveal the embedded hierarchical community structure with multiresolution in large-scale weighted undirected networks, and identify hubs and outliers as well. Moreover, it overcomes the sensitive threshold problem of density-based clustering algorithms and the resolution limit possessed by other modularity-based methods. To illustrate our methodology, we conduct experiments with both real-world and synthetic datasets for community detection, and compare with many other baseline methods.

Existing methods put a strong constraint in defining moving object cluster, that they require the moving objects to stick together for consecutive timestamps. Our key observation is that the moving objects in a cluster may actually diverge temporarily and congregate at certain timestamps. Motivated by this, we propose the concept of swarm which captures the moving objects that move within arbitrary shape of clusters for certain timestamps that are possibly non-consecutive. The goal of our paper is to find all discriminative swarms, namely closed swarm. While the search space for closed swarms is prohibitively huge, we design a method, ObjectGrowth, to efficiently retrieve the answer. In ObjectGrowth, two effective pruning strategies are proposed to greatly reduce the search space and a novel closure checking rule is developed to report closed swarms on-the-fly.

Finally, we show that, in most cases, CETR achieves better content extraction performance than existing methods, especially across varying web domains, languages and styles.", "year": "2010", "venue": "Proceedings of the 19th international conference on World wide web", "citations": ["5390b04120f70186a0ed8699", "5390b1d220f70186a0ee1418", "5390b20120f70186a0ee3f61", "5390b48420f70186a0efac5b", "5390b86b20f70186a0f28b36", "5390b9d520f70186a0f31ef4", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f32a98", "5390ba3820f70186a0f36b21", "5390bae520f70186a0f3b88a", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d1bc", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40b8d", "558b0eb7612c41e6b9d41bea", "558b2afa612c41e6b9d456ff", "559252130cf28b1a968ffb20"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfb0ac", "5390980720f70186a0e038f6", "5390981d20f70186a0e06019", "5390985d20f70186a0e07136", "539098b820f70186a0e0ad1a", "539099a220f70186a0e17d3e", "5390a1e620f70186a0e5a8af", "5390a1e620f70186a0e5a8b6", "5390a25820f70186a0e5f499", "5390a2e920f70186a0e67647", "5390a40520f70186a0e6e5cb", "5390a96e20f70186a0ea32dc", "539087e720f70186a0d69665", "5390880720f70186a0d79099", "5390881220f70186a0d7d68a", "5390881820f70186a0d81a91", "5390882420f70186a0d890f0", "539089ab20f70186a0d96f59", "539089bb20f70186a0d97cb6", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc440", "5390880d20f70186a0d7bff8", "5390958a20f70186a0df049f", "5390958a20f70186a0df05d6", "539095ba20f70186a0df0962", "539096cb20f70186a0df7a10", "5390b3ae20f70186a0ef4a7e", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc418"], "authors": ["Tim Weninger", "William H.

This is especially important in recent studies of association or correlation pattern mining. However, it is still not clear whether there is any intrinsic relationship among many proposed measures, and which one is truly effective at gauging object relationships in large data sets. Recent studies have identified a critical property, null-(transaction) invariance, for measuring associations among events in large data sets, but many measures do not have this property. In this study, we re-examine a set of null-invariant interestingness measures and find that they can be expressed as the generalized mathematical mean, leading to a total ordering of them. Such a unified framework provides insights into the underlying philosophy of the measures and helps us understand and select the proper measure for different applications. Moreover, we propose a new measure called Imbalance Ratio to gauge the degree of skewness of a data set. We also discuss the efficient computation of interesting patterns of different null-invariant interestingness measures by proposing an algorithm, GAMiner, which complements previous studies. Experimental evaluation verifies the effectiveness of the unified framework and shows that GAMiner speeds up the state-of-the-art algorithm by an order of magnitude.", "year": "2010", "venue": "Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery", "citations": ["5390ac1720f70186a0eb2873", "5390adfd20f70186a0ec66df", "5390b13020f70186a0edd8cb", "5390b29820f70186a0eeab5c", "5390b4c320f70186a0efdc04", "5390b5df20f70186a0f0b977", "5390b7fe20f70186a0f265b5", "5390b86b20f70186a0f28a95", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2b587", "5390b9d520f70186a0f2feeb", "5390ba3820f70186a0f37147", "5390be6620f70186a0f4d29a", "5390bed320f70186a0f4d9af", "558aeef3612c41e6b9d3dc6d", "5390bfa220f70186a0f54770", "55323bc045cec66b6f9da83b", "55323bc045cec66b6f9da81f"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe10", "5390972920f70186a0dfbe23", "53909f2d20f70186a0e38336", "5390a1d420f70186a0e569c5", "539087dd20f70186a0d644ca", "539087dd20f70186a0d644cc", "5390880220f70186a0d75ed5", "5390882c20f70186a0d8c827", "53908a4020f70186a0d9dc84", "53908a5720f70186a0da0b51", "53908a9620f70186a0da4bb0", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc3d5", "53908bfb20f70186a0dc9e48", "5390958a20f70186a0defdc0"], "authors": ["Tianyi Wu", "Yuguo Chen", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a7a5c60b4bee2de5d215"}}, {"index": "5390a9a420f70186a0ea4991", "title": "Entity relation discovery from web tables and links", "abstract": "The World-Wide Web consists not only of a huge number of unstructured texts, but also a vast amount of valuable structured data. Web tables [2] are a typical type of structured information that are pervasive on the web, and Web-scale methods that automatically extract web tables have been studied extensively [1]. Many powerful systems (e.g.OCTOPUS [4], Mesa [3]) use extracted web tables as a fundamental component. In the database vernacular, a table is defined as a set of tuples which have the same attributes. Similarly, a web table is defined as a set of rows (corresponding to database tuples) which have the same column headers (corresponding to database attributes). Therefore, to extract a web table is to extract a relation on the web. In databases, tables often contain foreign keys which refer to other tables. Therefore, it follows that hyperlinks inside a web table sometimes function as foreign keys to other relations whose tuples are contained in the hyperlink's target pages. In this paper, we explore this idea by asking: can we discover new attributes for web tables by exploring hyperlinks inside web tables? This poster proposes a solution that takes a web table as input. Frequent patterns are generated as new candidate relations by following hyperlinks in the web table. The confidence of candidates are evaluated, and trustworthy candidates are selected to become new attributes for the table.

Warehousing and mining this data is an essential problem with great potential benefits for inventory management, object tracking, and product procurement processes. Since RFID tags can be used to identify each individual item, enormous amounts of location-tracking data are generated. With such data, object movements can be modeled by movement graphs, where nodes correspond to locations and edges record the history of item transitions between locations. In this study, we develop a movement graph model as a compact representation of RFID data sets. Since spatiotemporal as well as item information can be associated with the objects in such a model, the movement graph can be huge, complex, and multidimensional in nature. We show that such a graph can be better organized around gateway nodes, which serve as bridges connecting different regions of the movement graph. A graph-based object movement cube can be constructed by merging and collapsing nodes and edges according to an application-oriented topological structure.

The tool was deployed and tested in a remote solar-powered sensing network for acoustic and visual environmental monitoring. It was shown to successfully distinguish between several categories of failures that cause unresponsive behavior including energy depletion, antenna damage, radio disconnection, system crashes, and anomalous reboots.

Users and most specifically DIME application developers face problems of finding (detecting), localizing such anomalies, and adapting against them in real-time. Current practices are to collect joint application-system metadata characterizing behaviors of application and system components while a DIME session is running, and then analyze them offline. Our goal is to provide a framework, called DIAMOND, that allows for real-time and unobtrusive collection and organization of joint application-system metadata in order to assist in finding such correlation violations in the system.

It is often desirable to find merit in an object (e.g., product, person, organization, or other business entity) and promote it in an appropriate community confidently. In this thesis, we motivate and discuss a novel class of data mining problems, called promotion analysis, for promoting a given object in a multi-dimensional space by leveraging object ranking information. The key observation is that most objects may not be highly ranked in the global space, where all objects are compared by all aspects; in contrast, there often exist interesting and meaningful local spaces in which the given object becomes prominent. Therefore, our general goal is to break down the data space and discover the most interesting local spaces in an effective and efficient way. We formally present the promotion analysis problem and formulate its variants and related notions. The promotion analysis problem is highly practical and useful in a wide spectrum of decision support applications. Typical application examples include merit discovery, product positioning and customer targeting, object profiling and summarization, identification of interesting features, and explorative search of objects. In fact, these applications are not new as they have been extensively studied and practiced in the marketing field. While existing commercial database and business intelligence systems can well support the functionality of retrieving the most highly ranked objects in some local space, there exists no multidimensional ranking analysis study for promotional purposes. Supporting effective and efficient online promotion analysis, nevertheless, presents many technical challenges, such as the spurious promotion problem, explosion of search space, and the high complexity of aggregation. Toward this end, we systematically study the problem and develop a general, principled promotion analysis framework. In terms of the search space, both subspaces formed on categorical dimensions and regions formed on continuous dimensions are examined. In terms of the object domain, both uniform object collection and multidimensional object space are studied. Moreover, we propose a unified query model to accommodate various scoring functions and redundancy-aware semantics. We also develop a statistical method to avoid spurious promotion results. For efficient query processing with a desirable balance between online and offline costs, we investigate exact algorithms as well as approximate algorithms with probabilistic guarantee. The promotion analysis framework not only provides an integrated solution for decision support applications, but also opens up new horizons for future research in other areas like information network analysis, text mining, and probabilistic data management.", "year": "2010", "venue": "A framework for promotion analysis in multi-dimensional space", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["Jiawei Han", "Tianyi Wu"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a828c60b4bee2debc1a6"}}, {"index": "5390ad0720f70186a0ebb22d", "title": "The wisdom of social multimedia: using flickr for prediction and forecast", "abstract": "Social multimedia hosting and sharing websites, such as Flickr, Facebook, Youtube, Picasa, ImageShack and Photobucket, are increasingly popular around the globe.

An interesting challenge in such an evaluation method is thus how to aggregate these different ideal lists to compute a single score for an ordered list to be evaluated. In this paper, we propose three new methods for aggregating multiple order judgments to evaluate ordered lists: weighted correlation aggregation, rank-based aggregation, and frequent sequential pattern-based aggregation. Experiment results on ordering sentences for text summarization show that all the three new methods outperform the state of the art average correlation methods in terms of discriminativeness and robustness against noise.

We present DXMiner, which addresses four major challenges to data stream classification, namely, infinite length, concept-drift, concept-evolution, and feature-evolution. Data streams are assumed to be infinite in length, which necessitates single-pass incremental learning techniques. Concept-drift occurs in a data stream when the underlying concept changes over time. Most existing data stream classification techniques address only the infinite length and concept-drift problems. However, concept-evolution and feature- evolution are also major challenges, and these are ignored by most of the existing approaches. Concept-evolution occurs in the stream when novel classes arrive, and feature-evolution occurs when new features emerge in the stream. Our previous work addresses the concept-evolution problem in addition to addressing the infinite length and concept-drift problems. Most of the existing data stream classification techniques, including our previous work, assume that the feature space of the data points in the stream is static. This assumption may be impractical for some type of data, for example text data.

Discovery of those relationships can benefit many interesting applications such as expert finding and research community analysis. In this paper, we take a computer science bibliographic network as an example, to analyze the roles of authors and to discover the likely advisor-advisee relationships. In particular, we propose a time-constrained probabilistic factor graph model (TPFG), which takes a research publication network as input and models the advisor-advisee relationship mining problem using a jointly likelihood objective function.

From among the hundreds of features which were developed, syntactic features were best able to reflect an author's writing style.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to mining discriminative k-embedded-edge subtree patterns from a given set of syntactic trees that reduces the computational burden of using complex syntactic structures as a feature set.

A popular trend is that users share their image collections within social groups, which greatly promotes the interactions between users and expands their social networks. Existing systems have difficulties in generating satisfactory social group suggestions because the images are classified independently and their relationship in a collection is ignored. In this work, we intend to produce suggestions of suitable photo-sharing groups from a user's personal photo collection by mining images on the Web and leveraging the collection context. Both visual content and textual annotations are integrated to generate initial prediction of the events or topics depicted in the images. A user collection-based label propagation method is proposed to improve the group suggestion by modeling the relationship of images in the same collection as a sparse weighted graph.

For example, a health application might compute a model relating exercise and diet to amount of weight loss. While the ultimately computed model could be public, the individual input and output data traces used to construct it may be private data of participants (e.g., their individual food intake, lifestyle choices, and resulting weight). This paper proposes and experimentally studies a technique that attempts to keep such input and output data traces private, while allowing accurate model construction. This is significantly different from perturbation-based techniques in that no noise is added. The main contribution of the paper is to show a certain data transformation at the client side that helps keeping the client data private while not introducing any additional error to model construction. We particularly focus on linear regression models which are widely used in participatory sensing applications. We use the data set from a map-based participatory sensing service to evaluate our scheme. The service in question is a green navigation service that constructs regression models from participant data to predict the fuel consumption of vehicles on road segments. We evaluate our proposed mechanism by providing empirical evidence that: i) an individual data trace is generally hard to reconstruct with any reasonable accuracy, and ii) the regression model constructed using the transformed traces has a much smaller error than one based on additive data-perturbation schemes.", "year": "2010", "venue": "Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems", "citations": ["5390b0ca20f70186a0ed9b25", "5390b13020f70186a0ede202", "5390b4c320f70186a0efe2e3", "5390b56a20f70186a0f06743", "5390b9d520f70186a0f309e2", "5390bda020f70186a0f46ff2"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe52", "5390985d20f70186a0e06e49", "539098dc20f70186a0e0e0ac", "539099a220f70186a0e18012", "53909a0220f70186a0e2021f", "53909e7c20f70186a0e2c075", "53909eef20f70186a0e355f7", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40f80", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4da95", "5390a25820f70186a0e5efc1", "5390a6d920f70186a0e88219", "5390aa0f20f70186a0ea85f2", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab865", "5390aaf920f70186a0ead504", "5390877920f70186a0d2d1c9", "5390879220f70186a0d3d1fa", "5390880220f70186a0d75f15", "5390881220f70186a0d7e2b1", "5390881820f70186a0d812d6", "53908a5820f70186a0da11b2", "53908adf20f70186a0dac4ea", "53908b4920f70186a0dbbef8", "53908b4920f70186a0dbbefa", "53908b4920f70186a0dbbef6", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc210", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc420", "5390958a20f70186a0defde3", "539096cb20f70186a0df8915", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1eeb", "5390b48420f70186a0efb16d"], "authors": ["Hossein Ahmadi", "Nam Pham", "Raghu Ganti", "Tarek Abdelzaher", "Suman Nath", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a8c0c60b4bee2df3ac74"}}, {"index": "5390aeba20f70186a0ec9b22", "title": "Link Mining: Models, Algorithms, and Applications", "abstract": "This book presents in-depth surveys and systematic discussions on models, algorithms and applications for link mining.

Finding periodic behaviors is essential to understanding object movements. However, periodic behaviors could be complicated, involving multiple interleaving periods, partial time span, and spatiotemporal noises and outliers. In this paper, we address the problem of mining periodic behaviors for moving objects. It involves two sub-problems: how to detect the periods in complex movement, and how to mine periodic movement behaviors. Our main assumption is that the observed movement is generated from multiple interleaved periodic behaviors associated with certain reference locations. Based on this assumption, we propose a two-stage algorithm, Periodica, to solve the problem. At the first stage, the notion of observation spot is proposed to capture the reference locations. Through observation spots, multiple periods in the movement can be retrieved using a method that combines Fourier transform and autocorrelation.

Two such well studied aspects are infinite length and concept-drift. Since a data stream may be considered a continuous process, which is theoretically infinite in length, it is impractical to store and use all the historical data for training. Data streams also frequently experience concept-drift as a result of changes in the underlying concepts. However, another important characteristic of data streams, namely, concept-evolution is rarely addressed in the literature. Concept-evolution occurs as a result of new classes evolving in the stream. This paper addresses concept-evolution in addition to the existing challenges of infinite-length and concept-drift. In this paper, the concept-evolution phenomenon is studied, and the insights are used to construct superior novel class detection techniques. First, we propose an adaptive threshold for outlier detection, which is a vital part of novel class detection. Second, we propose a probabilistic approach for novel class detection using discrete Gini Coefficient, and prove its effectiveness both theoretically and empirically. Finally, we address the issue of simultaneous multiple novel class occurrence, and provide an elegant solution to detect more than one novel classes at the same time. We also consider feature-evolution in text data streams, which occurs because new features (i.e., words) evolve in the stream.

There are two challenges in multi-label learning: (1) the labels are interdependent and correlated, and (2) the data are of high dimensionality. In this paper, we aim to tackle these challenges in one shot. In particular, we propose to learn the label correlation and do feature selection simultaneously. We introduce a matrix-variate Normal prior distribution on the weight vectors of the classifier to model the label correlation. Our goal is to find a subset of features, based on which the label correlation regularized loss of label ranking is minimized. The resulting multi-label feature selection problem is a mixed integer programming, which is reformulated as quadratically constrained linear programming (QCLP). It can be solved by cutting plane algorithm, in each iteration of which a minimax optimization problem is solved by dual coordinate descent and projected sub-gradient descent alternatively.

Our technique is also novel in the sense that it provides a measure of confidence in predictions. An application to green transportation is discussed, where the goal is to reduce vehicular fuel consumption and carbon footprint. First-principle models of cyber-physical systems can be very complex and include a large number of parameters, whereas empirical regression models are often unreliable when a high number of parameters is involved. Our new modeling technique, called the Sparse Regression Cube, simultaneously (i) partitions sparse, high-dimensional measurements into subspaces within which reliable linear regression models apply and (ii) determines the best reliable model for each partition, quantifying uncertainty in output prediction.

Being based on causal order, a global notion of time is not required in uncovering bug-triggering distributed event patterns. Bug triggering event DAGs can be identified by comparing execution graphs from successful runs to those where bug manifestations were observed, and exposing the minimal discriminative event DAGs that may be responsible for the problem. This is a significant extension to prior debugging tools, in that prior work considered much simpler bug-triggering conditions such as single events, event sets, or ordered chains of events.

In such mining, null (transaction)-invariance is an important property of the correlation measures. Unfortunately, some useful null-invariant measures such as Kulczynski and Cosine, which can discover correlations even for the very unbalanced cases, lack the (anti)-monotonicity property. Thus, they could only be applied to frequent itemsets as the post-evaluation step. For large datasets and for low supports, this approach is computationally prohibitive. This paper presents new properties for all known null-invariant measures. Based on these properties, we develop efficient pruning techniques and design the Apriori-like algorithm NICOMINER for mining strongly correlated patterns directly. We develop both the threshold-bounded and the top-k variations of the algorithm, where top-k is used when the optimal correlation threshold is not known in advance and to give user control over the output size. We test NICOMINER on real-life datasets from different application domains, using Cosine as an example of the null-invariant correlation measure. We show that NICOMINER outperforms support-based approach more than an order of magnitude, and that it is very useful for discovering top correlations in itemsets with low support.", "year": "2011", "venue": "ECML PKDD'11 Proceedings of the 2011 European conference on Machine learning and knowledge discovery in databases - Volume Part II", "citations": ["5390b71120f70186a0f1ec9d", "5390b72e20f70186a0f20690", "5390b86b20f70186a0f28a95", "558aeef3612c41e6b9d3dc6d", "55323bc045cec66b6f9da81f"], "references": ["5390985e20f70186a0e09113", "539098b820f70186a0e0ad9b", "539098dc20f70186a0e0d7eb", "5390a77d20f70186a0e8fd6d", "5390a77d20f70186a0e8fdc7", "539087be20f70186a0d51fe3", "5390ac5720f70186a0eb6129", "5390ad8920f70186a0ebff43", "539087dd20f70186a0d644cc", "53908a4020f70186a0d9dc84", "53908a9620f70186a0da4d84", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc3d5", "5390958a20f70186a0defdc0"], "authors": ["Sangkyum Kim", "Marina Barsky", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a6a1c60b4bee2dd9d379"}}, {"index": "5390b04120f70186a0ed8686", "title": "Learning search tasks in queries and web pages via graph regularization", "abstract": "As the Internet grows explosively, search engines play a more and more important role for users in effectively accessing online information. Recently, it has been recognized that a query is often triggered by a search task that the user wants to accomplish. Similarly, many web pages are specifically designed to help accomplish a certain task. Therefore, learning hidden tasks behind queries and web pages can help search engines return the most useful web pages to users by task matching. For instance, the search task that triggers query \"thinkpad T410 broken\" is to maintain a computer, and it is desirable for a search engine to return the Lenovo troubleshooting page on the top of the list. However, existing search engine technologies mainly focus on topic detection or relevance ranking, which are not able to predict the task that triggers a query and the task a web page can accomplish. In this paper, we propose to simultaneously classify queries and web pages into the popular search tasks by exploiting their content together with click-through logs. Specifically, we construct a taskoriented heterogeneous graph among queries and web pages. Each pair of objects in the graph are linked together as long as they potentially share similar search tasks. A novel graph-based regularization algorithm is designed for search task prediction by leveraging the graph. Extensive experiments in real search log data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over state-of-the-art classifiers, and the search performance can be significantly improved by using the task prediction results as additional information.", "year": "2011", "venue": "Proceedings of the 34th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in Information Retrieval", "citations": ["5390b71120f70186a0f1fd1d", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a716", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3dd3e", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f4137d", "5390bded20f70186a0f48d33", "5390be6620f70186a0f4c2b3", "558bcff20cf20e727d0f2001"], "references": ["5390979920f70186a0e001b1", "5390981d20f70186a0e05a0d", "5390995d20f70186a0e16659", "53909ed120f70186a0e30f17", "53909ee020f70186a0e32216", "5390a01420f70186a0e471ee", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4f43a", "5390a25820f70186a0e5ec39", "5390a40520f70186a0e6e599", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75048", "5390a54720f70186a0e788f7", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82f5b", "5390a72220f70186a0e8964c", "5390a9a420f70186a0ea495c", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebdf38", "539087e720f70186a0d69667", "53908b9320f70186a0dbfa31", "539096cb20f70186a0df79df"], "authors": ["Ming Ji", "Jun Yan", "Siyu Gu", "Jiawei Han", "Xiaofei He", "Wei Vivian Zhang", "Zheng Chen"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a6adc60b4bee2dda6b04"}}, {"index": "5390b13020f70186a0edc02f", "title": "Construction and analysis of web-based computer science information networks", "abstract": "", "year": "2011", "venue": "RSFDGrC'11 Proceedings of the 13th international conference on Rough sets, fuzzy sets, data mining and granular computing", "citations": ["5390b48420f70186a0efc770"], "references": ["5390a37f20f70186a0e6bc28", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75038", "5390ac1720f70186a0eb2873", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba982", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebdf38", "5390af8820f70186a0ececaf", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed456a"], "authors": ["Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a6bcc60b4bee2ddb224f"}}, {"index": "5390af8920f70186a0ed0afb", "title": "Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques", "abstract": "The increasing volume of data in modern business and science calls for more complex and sophisticated tools.

In multimedia content analysis, automatic social group recommendation for images holds the promise to expand one's social network through media sharing. However, most existing techniques cannot generate satisfactory social group suggestions when the images are classified independently. In this article, we present novel methods to produce accurate suggestions of suitable social groups from a user's personal photo collection. First, an automatic clustering process is designed to estimate the group similarities, select the optimal number of clusters and categorize the social groups. Both visual content and textual annotations are integrated to generate initial predictions of the group categories for the images. Next, the relationship among images in a user's collection is modeled as a sparse graph. A collection-based sparse label propagation method is proposed to improve the group suggestions. Furthermore, the sparse graph-based collection model can be readily exploited to select the most influential and informative samples for active relevance feedback, which can be integrated with the label propagation process without the need for classifier retraining. The proposed methods have been tested on group suggestion tasks for real user collections and demonstrated superior performance over the state-of-the-art techniques.", "year": "2011", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST)", "citations": ["5390b71120f70186a0f1f76a", "55924e7f0cf26384af04a3dd"], "references": ["539098b820f70186a0e0a833", "539098b820f70186a0e0a875", "539098b820f70186a0e0ae77", "53909ed120f70186a0e30942", "53909fca20f70186a0e44d46", "53909fca20f70186a0e44d87", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4e87b", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4e8a4", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4e88a", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4f43c", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4f42c", "5390a25820f70186a0e5ec47", "5390a25820f70186a0e5ec6a", "5390a25820f70186a0e5ec97", "5390a25820f70186a0e5ec48", "5390a25820f70186a0e5ecf4", "5390a25820f70186a0e5eecf", "5390a40520f70186a0e6e58e", "5390a40520f70186a0e6e5b7", "5390a40520f70186a0e6e5ae", "5390a63d20f70186a0e8360b", "5390a6b220f70186a0e861e8", "5390a72220f70186a0e89799", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea7e76", "539087e720f70186a0d6969e", "539087f820f70186a0d71370", "539087fe20f70186a0d7519f", "539089ab20f70186a0d95f7a", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc410", "53908b9320f70186a0dc040d", "5390958920f70186a0deea5b", "5390b56a20f70186a0f05f0a", "5390b64020f70186a0f1a208"], "authors": ["Jie Yu", "Xin Jin", "Jiawei Han", "Jiebo Luo"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a715c60b4bee2ddef8ff"}}, {"index": "5390b2fc20f70186a0eefa61", "title": "Detecting Recurring and Novel Classes in Concept-Drifting Data Streams", "abstract": "Concept-evolution is one of the major challenges in data stream classification, which occurs when a new class evolves in the stream. This problem remains unaddressed by most state-of-the-art techniques. A recurring class is a special case of concept-evolution. This special case takes place when a class appears in the stream, then disappears for a long time, and again appears. Existing data stream classification techniques that address the concept-evolution problem, wrongly detect the recurring classes as novel class. This creates two main problems. First, much resource is wasted in detecting a recurring class as novel class, because novel class detection is much more computationally- and memory-intensive, as compared to simply recognizing an existing class. Second, when a novel class is identified, human experts are involved in collecting and labeling the instances of that class for future modeling. If a recurrent class is reported as novel class, it will be only a waste of human effort to find out whether it is really a novel class. In this paper, we address the recurring issue, and propose a more realistic novel class detection technique, which remembers a class and identifies it as \"not novel\" when it reappears after a long disappearance.

Both classification and ranking of the nodes (or data objects) in such networks are essential for network analysis. However, so far these approaches have generally been performed separately. In this paper, we combine ranking and classification in order to perform more accurate analysis of a heterogeneous information network. Our intuition is that highly ranked objects within a class should play more important roles in classification. On the other hand, class membership information is important for determining a quality ranking over a dataset. We believe it is therefore beneficial to integrate classification and ranking in a simultaneous, mutually enhancing process, and to this end, propose a novel ranking-based iterative classification framework, called RankClass. Specifically, we build a graph-based ranking model to iteratively compute the ranking distribution of the objects within each class. At each iteration, according to the current ranking results, the graph structure used in the ranking algorithm is adjusted so that the sub-network corresponding to the specific class is emphasized, while the rest of the network is weakened. As our experiments show, integrating ranking with classification not only generates more accurate classes than the state-of-art classification methods on networked data, but also provides meaningful ranking of objects within each class, serving as a more informative view of the data than traditional classification.", "year": "2011", "venue": "Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["5390b71120f70186a0f1e250", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e30a", "5390b72d20f70186a0f20469", "5390b78a20f70186a0f23ecd", "5390b86b20f70186a0f29679", "5390b95520f70186a0f2f679", "5390baa120f70186a0f37f02", "5390bae520f70186a0f3bbbd", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d0d8", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d0f9", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d117", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3df72", "5390bd1520f70186a0f432a6", "5390be6620f70186a0f4c2be", "5390be6620f70186a0f4c2b6", "5390be6620f70186a0f4c2d8", "5390be6620f70186a0f4c38a", "5390bf1320f70186a0f51b0e", "558b26a0612c41e6b9d44e8e", "558ae647612c41e6b9d3cce3", "558b1a24612c41e6b9d4357a", "558ad324612c41e6b9d3afa7", "558b09b6612c41e6b9d41089", "558b0dbc612c41e6b9d419e7", "558b2dd0612c41e6b9d45cc6", "558aec10612c41e6b9d3d91a"], "references": ["5390981d20f70186a0e05a1f", "5390985e20f70186a0e08e89", "539099a220f70186a0e18417", "53909ee020f70186a0e32248", "53909ee020f70186a0e32252", "539087a620f70186a0d49a70", "5390a17720f70186a0e5245b", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75045", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e75038", "5390a72220f70186a0e896fb", "5390a74f20f70186a0e8c996", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebdf38", "539087e120f70186a0d661ee", "539087ef20f70186a0d6e1ac", "539087f820f70186a0d714df", "539087fe20f70186a0d73a8b"], "authors": ["Ming Ji", "Jiawei Han", "Marina Danilevsky"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a757c60b4bee2de202b2"}}, {"index": "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda9c0", "title": "Probabilistic topic models with biased propagation on heterogeneous information networks", "abstract": "With the development of Web applications, textual documents are not only getting richer, but also ubiquitously interconnected with users and other objects in various ways, which brings about text-rich heterogeneous information networks. Topic models have been proposed and shown to be useful for document analysis, and the interactions among multi-typed objects play a key role at disclosing the rich semantics of the network. However, most of topic models only consider the textual information while ignore the network structures or can merely integrate with homogeneous networks. None of them can handle heterogeneous information network well. In this paper, we propose a novel topic model with biased propagation (TMBP) algorithm to directly incorporate heterogeneous information network with topic modeling in a unified way. The underlying intuition is that multi-typed objects should be treated differently along with their inherent textual information and the rich semantics of the heterogeneous information network. A simple and unbiased topic propagation across such a heterogeneous network does not make much sense. Consequently, we investigate and develop two biased propagation frameworks, the biased random walk framework and the biased regularization framework, for the TMBP algorithm from different perspectives, which can discover latent topics and identify clusters of multi-typed objects simultaneously. We extensively evaluate the proposed approach and compare to the state-of-the-art techniques on several datasets.

K-Means is one of the most popular clustering algorithms, due to its high efficiency/effectiveness and wide implementation in many commercial/noncommercial softwares. Performing efficient clustering on large dataset is especially useful; however, conducting K-Means clustering on large data suffers heavy computation burden which originates from the numerous distance calculations between the patterns and the centers. This paper proposes framework General Activity Detection (GAD) for fast clustering on large-scale data based on center activity detection. Within this framework, we design a set of algorithms for different scenarios: (i) exact GAD algorithm, E-GAD, which is much faster than K-Means and gets the same clustering result; (ii) approximate GAD algorithms with different assumptions, which are faster than E-GAD, while achieving different degrees of approximation; and (iii) GAD based algorithms to handle the large clusters problem which appears in many large-scale clustering applications. The framework provides a general solution to exploit activity detection for fast clustering in both exact and approximate scenarios, and our proposed algorithms within the framework can achieve very high speed. We have conducted extensive experiments on several datasets from various real world applications, including data compression, image clustering, and bioinformatics. By measuring the clustering quality and CPU time, the experiment results show the effectiveness and high efficiency of our proposed algorithms. Copyright \u00a9 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

For example, a company wants to market a new product through the effect of ``word of mouth'' in the social network. It wishes to find and convince a small number of influential users to adopt the product, and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions. Fundamentally, we need to answer the following question: how to quantify the influence between two users in a large social network? To address this question, we propose a pair wise factor graph (PFG) model to model the social influence in social networks. An efficient algorithm is designed to learn the model and make inference. We further propose a dynamic factor graph (DFG) model to incorporate the time information. Experimental results on three different genres of data sets show that the proposed approaches can efficiently infer the dynamic social influence. The results are applied to the influence maximization problem, which aims to find a small subset of nodes (users) in a social network that could maximize the spread of influence.

Analyzing such data has deep implications in many applications, such as, ecological study, traffic control, mobile communication management, and climatological forecast. In this article, we focus our study on animal movement data analysis and examine advanced data mining methods for discovery of various animal movement patterns. In particular, we introduce a moving object data mining system, MoveMine, which integrates multiple data mining functions, including sophisticated pattern mining and trajectory analysis. In this system, two interesting moving object pattern mining functions are newly developed: (1) periodic behavior mining and (2) swarm pattern mining. For mining periodic behaviors, a reference location-based method is developed, which first detects the reference locations, discovers the periods in complex movements, and then finds periodic patterns by hierarchical clustering. For mining swarm patterns, an efficient method is developed to uncover flexible moving object clusters by relaxing the popularly-enforced collective movement constraints. In the MoveMine system, a set of commonly used moving object mining functions are built and a user-friendly interface is provided to facilitate interactive exploration of moving object data mining and flexible tuning of the mining constraints and parameters. MoveMine has been tested on multiple kinds of real datasets, especially for MoveBank applications and other moving object data analysis. The system will benefit scientists and other users to carry out versatile analysis tasks to analyze object movement regularities and anomalies. Moreover, it will benefit researchers to realize the importance and limitations of current techniques and promote future studies on moving object data mining.

TEXplorer can be implemented within a multi-dimensional text database, where each row is associated with structural dimensions (attributes) and text data (e.g., a document). The system utilizes the text cube data model, where a cell aggregates a set of documents with matching values in a subset of dimensions. Cells in a text cube capture different levels of summarization of the documents, and can represent objects at different conceptual levels. Users query the system by submitting a set of keywords. Instead of returning a ranked list of all the cells, we propose a keyword-based interactive exploration framework that could offer flexible OLAP navigational guides and help users identify the levels and objects they are interested in. A novel significance measure of dimensions is proposed based on the distribution of IR relevance of cells.

In this paper, we study the problem of keyword search in a data cube with text-rich dimension(s) (so-called text cube). The text cube is built on a multidimensional text database, where each row is associated with some text data (a document) and other structural dimensions (attributes). A cell in the text cube aggregates a set of documents with matching attribute values in a subset of dimensions. We define a keyword-based query language and an IR-style relevance model for scoring/ranking cells in the text cube. Given a keyword query, our goal is to find the top-k most relevant cells. We propose four approaches: inverted-index one-scan, document sorted-scan, bottom-up dynamic programming, and search-space ordering. The search-space ordering algorithm explores only a small portion of the text cube for finding the top-k answers, and enables early termination.

Novel class detection problem becomes more challenging in the presence of concept-drift, when the underlying data distributions evolve in streams. In order to determine whether an instance belongs to a novel class, the classification model sometimes needs to wait for more test instances to discover similarities among those instances. A maximum allowable wait time T_c is imposed as a time constraint to classify a test instance. Furthermore, most existing stream classification approaches assume that the true label of a data point can be accessed immediately after the data point is classified. In reality, a time delay T_l is involved in obtaining the true label of a data point since manual labeling is time consuming.

Central to our approach is a graph model which captures the local geometry of the document submanifold. Thus, we call it Locally Consistent Concept Factorization (LCCF).

Estimating the frequency of the items on these streams is an important aggregation and summary technique for both stream mining and data management systems with a broad range of applications. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art progress on methods of identifying frequent items from data streams. It describes different kinds of models for frequent items mining task. For general models such as cash register and Turnstile, we classify existing algorithms into sampling-based, counting-based, and hashing-based categories. The processing techniques and data synopsis structure of each algorithm are described and compared by evaluation measures. Accordingly, as an extension of the general data stream model, four more specific models including time-sensitive model, distributed model, hierarchical and multi-dimensional model, and skewed data model are introduced.

A vast ocean of data are collected from trillions of connected devices in real time on a daily basis, and useful knowledge is usually buried in data of multiple genres, from different sources, in different formats, and with different types of representation. Many interesting patterns cannot be extracted from a single data collection, but have to be discovered from the integrative analysis of all heterogeneous data sources available. Although many algorithms have been developed to analyze multiple information sources, real applications continuously pose new challenges: Data can be gigantic, noisy, unreliable, dynamically evolving, highly imbalanced, and heterogeneous. Meanwhile, users provide limited feedback, have growing privacy concerns, and ask for actionable knowledge. In this thesis, we propose to explore the power of multiple heterogeneous information sources in such challenging learning scenarios. There are two interesting perspectives in learning from the correlations among multiple information sources: Explore their similarities (consensus combination), or their differences (inconsistency detection). In consensus combination, we focus on the task of classification with multiple information sources. Multiple information sources for the same set of objects can provide complimentary predictive powers, and by combining their expertise, the prediction accuracy is significantly improved. However, the major challenge is that it is hard to obtain sufficient and reliable labeled data for effective training because they require the efforts of experienced human annotators. In some data sources, we may only have a large amount of unlabeled data. Although such unlabeled information do not directly generate label predictions, they provide useful constraints on the classification task. Therefore, we first propose a graph based consensus maximization framework to combine multiple supervised and unsupervised models obtained from all the available information sources. We further demonstrate the benefits of combining multiple models on two specific learning scenarios. In transfer learning, we propose an effective model combination framework to transfer knowledge from multiple sources to a target domain with no labeled data. We also demonstrate the robustness of model combination on dynamically evolving data.On the other hand, when unexpected disagreement is encountered across diverse information sources, this might raise a red flag and require in-depth investigation. Another line of my thesis research is to explore differences among multiple information sources to find anomalies. We first propose a spectral method to detect objects performing inconsistently across multiple heterogeneous information sources as a new type of anomalies. Traditional anomaly detection methods discover anomalies based on the degree of deviation from normal objects in one data source, whereas the proposed approach detects anomalies according to the degree of inconsistencies across multiple sources. The principle of inconsistency detection can benefit many applications, and in particular, we show how this principle can help identify anomalies in information networks and distributed systems. We propose probabilistic models to detect anomalies in a social community by comparing link and node information, and to detect system problems from connected machines in a distributed systems by modeling correlations among multiple machines.In this thesis, we go beyond the scope of traditional ensemble learning to address challenges faced by many applications with multiple data sources. With the proposed consensus combination framework, labeled data are no longer a requirement for successful multi-source classification, instead, the use of existing labeling experts is maximized by integratingknowledge from relevant do- mains and unlabeled information sources. The proposed concept of inconsistency detection across multiple data sources opens up a new direction of anomaly detection. The detected anomalies, which cannot be found by traditional anomaly detection techniques, provide new insights into the application area. The algorithms we developed have been proved useful in many areas, including social network analysis, cyber-security, and business intelligence, and have the potential of being applied to many other areas, such as healthcare, bioinformatics, and energy efficiency. As both the amount of data and the number of sources in our world have been exploding, there are still great opportunities as well as numerous research challenges for inference of actionable knowledge from multiple heterogeneous sources of massive data collections.", "year": "2011", "venue": "Exploring the power of heterogeneous information sources", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["Jiawei Han", "Jing Gao"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a80bc60b4bee2dea40b7"}}, {"index": "5390b13020f70186a0eddc85", "title": "Retrieving k-nearest neighboring trajectories by a set of point locations", "abstract": "The advance of object tracking technologies leads to huge volumes of spatio-temporal data accumulated in the form of location trajectories. Such data bring us new opportunities and challenges in efficient trajectory retrieval. In this paper, we study a new type of query that finds the k Nearest Neighboring Trajectories (k-NNT) with the minimum aggregated distance to a set of query points. Such queries, though have a broad range of applications like trip planning and moving object study, cannot be handled by traditional k-NN query processing techniques that only find the neighboring points of an object. To facilitate scalable, flexible and effective query execution, we propose a k-NN trajectory retrieval algorithm using a candidate-generation-and-verification strategy. The algorithm utilizes a data structure called global heap to retrieve candidate trajectories near each individual query point. Then, at the verification step, it refines these trajectory candidates by a lower-bound computed based on the global heap. The global heap guarantees the candidate's completeness (i.e., all the k-NNTs are included), and reduces the computational overhead of candidate verification. In addition, we propose a qualifier expectation measure that ranks partial-matching candidate trajectories to accelerate query processing in the cases of non-uniform trajectory distributions or outlier query locations.

Changes in the nodes and edges over time may also result in corresponding changes in structural garph properties such as shortest path distances. In this paper, we study the problem of detecting the top-k most significant shortest-path distance changes between two snapshots of an evolving graph. While the problem is solvable with two applications of the all-pairs shortest path algorithm, such a solution would be extremely slow and impractical for very large graphs. This is because when a graph may contain millions of nodes, even the storage of distances between all node pairs can become inefficient in practice. Therefore, it is desirable to design algorithms which can directly determine the significant changes in shortest path distances, without materializing the distances in individual snapshots.

While previous studies focus on mining objects being together for a long time, discovering real-world relationships, such as friends or colleagues in human trajectory data, is a fundamentally different challenge. For example, it is possible that two individuals are friends but do not spend a lot of time being together every day. However, spending just one or two hours together at a location away from work on a Saturday night could be a strong indicator of friend relationship. Based on the above observations, in this paper we aim to analyze and detect semantically meaningful relationships in a supervised way. That is, with an interested relationship in mind, a user can label some object pairs with and without such relationship. From labeled pairs, we will learn what time intervals are the most important ones in order to characterize this relationship. These significant time intervals, namely T-Motifs, are then used to discover relationships hidden in the unlabeled moving object pairs. While the search for T-Motifs could be time-consuming, we design two speed-up strategies to efficiently extract T-Motifs.

In a data cube, data from a fact table is aggregated on subsets of the table's dimensions, forming a collection of smaller tables called cuboids. When the fact table includes sensitive data such as salary or diagnosis, publishing even a subset of its cuboids may compromise individuals' privacy. In this paper, we address this problem using differential privacy (DP), which provides provable privacy guarantees for individuals by adding noise to query answers. We choose an initial subset of cuboids to compute directly from the fact table, injecting DP noise as usual; and then compute the remaining cuboids from the initial set. Given a fixed privacy guarantee, we show that it is NP-hard to choose the initial set of cuboids so that the maximal noise over all published cuboids is minimized, or so that the number of cuboids with noise below a given threshold (precise cuboids) is maximized. We provide an efficient procedure with running time polynomial in the number of cuboids to select the initial set of cuboids, such that the maximal noise in all published cuboids will be within a factor (ln|L| + 1)^2 of the optimal, where |L| is the number of cuboids to be published, or the number of precise cuboids will be within a factor (1 - 1/e) of the optimal. We also show how to enforce consistency in the published cuboids while simultaneously improving their utility (reducing error).

The projection vectors are commonly obtained by maximizing the between-class covariance and simultaneously minimizing the within-class covariance. LDA can be performed either in the original input space or in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) into which data points are mapped, which leads to kernel discriminant analysis (KDA). When the data are highly nonlinear distributed, KDA can achieve better performance than LDA. However, computing the projective functions in KDA involves eigen-decomposition of kernel matrix, which is very expensive when a large number of training samples exist. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for kernel discriminant analysis, called Spectral Regression Kernel Discriminant Analysis (SRKDA). By using spectral graph analysis, SRKDA casts discriminant analysis into a regression framework, which facilitates both efficient computation and the use of regularization techniques. Specifically, SRKDA only needs to solve a set of regularized regression problems, and there is no eigenvector computation involved, which is a huge save of computational cost. The new formulation makes it very easy to develop incremental version of the algorithm, which can fully utilize the computational results of the existing training samples. Moreover, it is easy to produce sparse projections (Sparse KDA) with a L 1-norm regularizer. Extensive experiments on spoken letter, handwritten digit image and face image data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.", "year": "2011", "venue": "The VLDB Journal \u2014 The International Journal on Very Large Data Bases", "citations": ["5390b4c320f70186a0efe0da", "5390bd1520f70186a0f43768", "5390bed320f70186a0f4e4ef"], "references": ["5390985d20f70186a0e06e84", "5390985e20f70186a0e094fc", "5390994d20f70186a0e1368d", "539099a220f70186a0e1841e", "539087a120f70186a0d466dc", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2e3be", "53909f6a20f70186a0e3b5ec", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3f7ea", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40d4d", "53909fca20f70186a0e44d45", "5390a1e620f70186a0e5ac17", "5390a1e620f70186a0e5ac3c", "5390a2e920f70186a0e671b8", "5390a6b120f70186a0e844f0", "5390879920f70186a0d406e0", "539087eb20f70186a0d6a40d", "5390881720f70186a0d800d9", "539089ab20f70186a0d94fd2", "539089d220f70186a0d9ace5", "53908a9620f70186a0da47d9", "5390958a20f70186a0def8e3", "5390b24420f70186a0ee790f", "5390b56a20f70186a0f05e09"], "authors": ["Deng Cai", "Xiaofei He", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a858c60b4bee2dee2794"}}, {"index": "5390b13020f70186a0edcf57", "title": "Heterogeneous network-based trust analysis: a survey", "abstract": "Different information sources publish information with different degrees of correctness and originality.

However, there is a lack of study on a new kind of data, trajectories on road networks. Modeling such data is useful with the emerging GPS and RFID technologies and is important for effective transportation and traffic planning. In this work, we study methods for classifying trajectories on road networks. By analyzing the behavior of trajectories on road networks, we observe that, in addition to the locations where vehicles have visited, the order of these visited locations is crucial for improving classification accuracy. Based on our analysis, we contend that (frequent) sequential patterns are good feature candidates since they preserve this order information. Furthermore, when mining sequential patterns, we propose to confine the length of sequential patterns to ensure high efficiency. Compared with closed sequential patterns, these partial (i.e., length-confined) sequential patterns allow us to significantly improve efficiency almost without losing accuracy. In this paper, we present a framework for frequent pattern-based classification for trajectories on road networks.

A novel and principled probabilistic model is proposed which casts our task as an joint inference problem, which considers textual documents, social influences, and topic evolution in a unified way. Specifically, a mixture model is introduced to model the generation of text according to the diffusion and the evolution of the topic, while the whole diffusion process is regularized with user-level social influences through a Gaussian Markov Random Field. Experiments on both synthetic data and real world data show that the discovery of topic diffusion and evolution benefits from this joint inference, and the probabilistic model we propose performs significantly better than existing methods.", "year": "2011", "venue": "ICDM '11 Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on Data Mining", "citations": ["5390b71120f70186a0f1e260", "5390b86b20f70186a0f28a95", "5390b9d520f70186a0f31ed8", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40baa", "5390bda020f70186a0f45d0d", "5390bda020f70186a0f474e1", "5390be6620f70186a0f4c9c4", "558b318e612c41e6b9d46499"], "references": [], "authors": ["Cindy Xide Lin", "Qiaozhu Mei", "Jiawei Han", "Yunliang Jiang", "Marina Danilevsky"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a8abc60b4bee2df29d93"}}, {"index": "5390b1d220f70186a0ee2347", "title": "Co-author Relationship Prediction in Heterogeneous Bibliographic Networks", "abstract": "The problem of predicting links or interactions between objects in a network, is an important task in network analysis. Along this line, link prediction between co-authors in a co-author network is a frequently studied problem. In most of these studies, authors are considered in a homogeneous network, \\i.e., only one type of objects(author type) and one type of links (co-authorship) exist in the network. However, in a real bibliographic network, there are multiple types of objects (\\e.g., venues, topics, papers) and multiple types of links among these objects. In this paper, we study the problem of co-author relationship prediction in the heterogeneous bibliographic network, and a new methodology called\\emph{Path Predict}, \\i.e., meta path-based relationship prediction model, is proposed to solve this problem. First, meta path-based topological features are systematically extracted from the network. Then, a supervised model is used to learn the best weights associated with different topological features in deciding the co-author relationships. We present experiments on a real bibliographic network, the DBLP network, which show that metapath-based heterogeneous topological features can generate more accurate prediction results as compared to homogeneous topological features. In addition, the level of significance of each topological feature can be learned from the model, which is helpful in understanding the mechanism behind the relationship building.", "year": "2011", "venue": "ASONAM '11 Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining", "citations": ["5390b36120f70186a0ef1293", "5390b61e20f70186a0f14c56", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e250", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e30a", "5390b78a20f70186a0f23ecd", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a6e9", "5390b8d620f70186a0f2ab4c", "5390ba3820f70186a0f36716", "5390ba3820f70186a0f36913", "5390ba3820f70186a0f369f7", "5390baa120f70186a0f37f02", "5390bae520f70186a0f3bbbd", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d295", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d374", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3df45", "5390bd1520f70186a0f4350a", "5390bd1520f70186a0f4409e", "5390be6620f70186a0f4ce44", "558b1a24612c41e6b9d4357a", "558b9623612c6b62e5e8c295", "558b0b5a612c41e6b9d414cf", "55922d770cf2c3a0875c9d88", "55323bc145cec66b6f9da852"], "references": [], "authors": ["Yizhou Sun", "Rick Barber", "Manish Gupta", "Charu C.

GPS-associated documents become popular with the pervasiveness of location-acquisition technologies. For example, in Flickr, the geo-tagged photos are associated with tags and GPS locations. In Twitter, the locations of the tweets can be identified by the GPS locations from smart phones. Many interesting concepts, including cultures, scenes, and product sales, correspond to specialized geographical distributions. In this paper, we are interested in two questions: (1) how to discover different topics of interests that are coherent in geographical regions? (2) how to compare several topics across different geographical locations? To answer these questions, this paper proposes and compares three ways of modeling geographical topics: location-driven model, text-driven model, and a novel joint model called LGTA (Latent Geographical Topic Analysis) that combines location and text. To make a fair comparison, we collect several representative datasets from Flickr website including Landscape, Activity, Manhattan, National park, Festival, Car, and Food. The results show that the first two methods work in some datasets but fail in others. LGTA works well in all these datasets at not only finding regions of interests but also providing effective comparisons of the topics across different locations. The results confirm our hypothesis that the geographical distributions can help modeling topics, while topics provide important cues to group different geographical regions.", "year": "2011", "venue": "Proceedings of the 20th international conference on World wide web", "citations": ["5390b0ca20f70186a0eda9c0", "5390b13020f70186a0edbd3d", "5390b24320f70186a0ee69b4", "5390b29820f70186a0eea5d3", "5390b36120f70186a0ef1255", "5390b4c420f70186a0efe9fb", "5390b4c420f70186a0efeab7", "5390b63320f70186a0f17700", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e267", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e2d0", "5390b71120f70186a0f1fd05", "5390b7ff20f70186a0f277b6", "5390b86b20f70186a0f29f84", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a067", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a65a", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2c10d", "5390b9d520f70186a0f302c9", "5390ba3820f70186a0f35287", "5390ba3820f70186a0f357da", "5390ba3820f70186a0f36b25", "5390ba3820f70186a0f36b3c", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c46b", "5390bae620f70186a0f3c42f", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d0d7", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d138", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d140", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d33f", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f3fae1", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f40c90", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f410e4", "5390bd1520f70186a0f432e2", "5390bda020f70186a0f45cd4", "5390bda020f70186a0f45fa5", "5390bda020f70186a0f46e7c", "5390bded20f70186a0f48dc8", "558b1763612c41e6b9d42e99", "5390be6620f70186a0f4c2af", "5390bf1320f70186a0f50dee", "558b14b2612c41e6b9d42757", "558b3118612c41e6b9d463b3", "558b318e612c41e6b9d46499", "558b89bb612c6b62e5e8b008", "558aee3f612c41e6b9d3daaa", "558b2f59612c41e6b9d45ffc", "55913d000cf232eb904fb662", "558b0f53612c41e6b9d41cff", "558e41ac0cf2c779a6477dc0", "558bd0c00cf20e727d0f2158", "558b1251612c41e6b9d42157", "559258b50cf205530abc98a4"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfbe5d", "5390995d20f70186a0e1664e", "539099b320f70186a0e19a31", "539099b320f70186a0e1a432", "53909f2d20f70186a0e38baa", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40280", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4a77d", "5390a05a20f70186a0e4a769", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4d373", "5390a40520f70186a0e6e5b6", "5390a88c20f70186a0e993cc", "539087f820f70186a0d71370", "5390881820f70186a0d81e95", "5390958920f70186a0deea5b"], "authors": ["Zhijun Yin", "Liangliang Cao", "Jiawei Han", "Chengxiang Zhai", "Thomas Huang"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a8c7c60b4bee2df402c7"}}, {"index": "5390b20120f70186a0ee5742", "title": "Hierarchical aggregate classification with limited supervision for data reduction in wireless sensor networks", "abstract": "The main challenge of designing classification algorithms for sensor networks is the lack of labeled sensory data, due to the high cost of manual labeling in the harsh locales where a sensor network is normally deployed. Moreover, delivering all the sensory data to the sink would cost enormous energy. Therefore, although some classification techniques can deal with limited label information, they cannot be directly applied to sensor networks since they are designed for centralized databases. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical aggregate classification (HAC) protocol which can reduce the amount of data sent by each node while achieving accurate classification in the face of insufficient label information. In this protocol, each sensor node locally makes cluster analysis and forwards only its decision to the parent node. The decisions are aggregated along the tree, and eventually the global agreement is achieved at the sink node. In addition, to control the tradeoff between the communication energy and the classification accuracy, we design an extended version of HAC, called the constrained hierarchical aggregate classification (cHAC) protocol. cHAC can achieve more accurate classification results compared with HAC, at the cost of more energy consumption. The advantages of our schemes are demonstrated through the experiments on not only synthetic data but also a real testbed.", "year": "2011", "venue": "Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems", "citations": ["5390bd1520f70186a0f440ce", "5591363e0cf232eb904fb468", "559166b80cf2e89307ca9937"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfa5ec", "5390980720f70186a0e02a07", "5390981d20f70186a0e06a0e", "539098dd20f70186a0e0e2f8", "539099a220f70186a0e190da", "539099a220f70186a0e190c5", "53909a0220f70186a0e2021a", "53909ed120f70186a0e2fca4", "53909f2d20f70186a0e3954a", "53909f6920f70186a0e3abdc", "53909f6920f70186a0e3aeae", "5390a1e620f70186a0e5a360", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e74c71", "5390a63c20f70186a0e82475", "5390a72220f70186a0e89019", "5390a79f20f70186a0e9271c", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea76a1", "5390aa7620f70186a0eab7e0", "5390af8920f70186a0ed0afb", "5390881720f70186a0d804e1", "5390882420f70186a0d88847", "539088b820f70186a0d8f81d", "539089d220f70186a0d99ff3", "53908ae020f70186a0dad456", "53908b2120f70186a0db5ee8", "5390b2d720f70186a0eed47f", "5390b52620f70186a0f03e9c"], "authors": ["Lu Su", "Jing Gao", "Yong Yang", "Tarek F.

Besides traditional cuboid queries, a new class of OLAP queries, crossboid, is introduced that is uniquely useful in multidimensional networks and has not been studied before.

Specifically, the sample-feature relationship is modeled by a bipartite graph between samples and features.

For each local patch in the sample and feature spaces, a local linear function is estimated to predict the labels of the points in this patch. The intersample and interfeature relationships are thus captured by minimizing the fitting errors of all the local linear functions.

We define such objects as community trend outliers. It is a challenging problem as evolutionary patterns are hidden deeply in noisy evolving datasets and thus it is difficult to distinguish anomalous objects from normal ones. We propose an effective two-step procedure to detect community trend outliers. We first model the normal evolutionary behavior of communities across time using soft patterns discovered from the dataset. In the second step, we propose effective measures to evaluate chances of an object deviating from the normal evolutionary patterns.

Anchor texts are useful because they are similar to typical Web queries, and because they express the document's context. Therefore, it is a common practice for Web search engines to incorporate incoming anchor text into the document's standard textual representation. However, this approach will not suffice for documents with very few inlinks, and it does not incorporate the document's full context. To mediate these problems, we employ link paths, which contain anchor texts from paths through the Web ending at the document in question.

Specifically, the sample-feature relationship is modeled by a bipartite graph between samples and features. And we apply local linear regression to discovering the intrinsic discriminative structures of both sample space and feature space. For each local patch in the sample and feature spaces, a local linear function is estimated to predict the labels of the points in this patch. The intersample and interfeature relationships are thus captured by minimizing the fitting errors of all the local linear functions. In this way, LDCC groups strongly associated samples and features together, while respecting the local structures of both sample and feature spaces.

To understand the temporal behavior and characteristics of the dataset and its elements, we need effective tools that can capture evolution of the objects.

Given a series of snapshots of a temporal dataset, each of which consists of evolving communities, our goal is to find objects which evolve in a dramatically different way compared with the other community members. We define such objects as community trend outliers. It is a challenging problem as evolutionary patterns are hidden deeply in noisy evolving datasets and thus it is difficult to distinguish anomalous objects from normal ones. We propose an effective two-step procedure to detect community trend outliers. We first model the normal evolutionary behavior of communities across time using soft patterns discovered from the dataset. In the second step, we propose effective measures to evaluate chances of an object deviating from the normal evolutionary patterns.

A major challenge for link-based clustering in such networks is its potential to generate many different results, carrying rather diverse semantic meanings. In order to generate desired clustering, we propose to use meta-path, a path that connects object types via a sequence of relations, to control clustering with distinct semantics. Nevertheless, it is easier for a user to provide a few examples (\"seeds\") than a weighted combination of sophisticated meta-paths to specify her clustering preference. Thus, we propose to integrate meta-path selection with user-guided clustering to cluster objects in networks, where a user first provides a small set of object seeds for each cluster as guidance. Then the system learns the weights for each meta-path that are consistent with the clustering result implied by the guidance, and generates clusters under the learned weights of meta-paths. A probabilistic approach is proposed to solve the problem, and an effective and efficient iterative algorithm, PathSelClus, is proposed to learn the model, where the clustering quality and the meta-path weights are mutually enhancing each other.

Usually objects form multiple communities, and most of the objects belonging to the same community follow similar patterns of evolution. However, there are some objects which evolve in a very different way relative to other community members, and we define such objects as evolutionary community outliers. This definition represents a novel type of outliers considering both temporal dimension and community patterns.

By structuring these data objects and interactions between these objects into multiple types, such networks become semi-structured heterogeneous information networks. Most real-world applications that handle big data, including interconnected social media and social networks, scientific, engineering, or medical information systems, online e-commerce systems, and most database systems, can be structured into heterogeneous information networks. Therefore, effective analysis of large-scale heterogeneous information networks poses an interesting but critical challenge. In this book, we investigate the principles and methodologies of mining heterogeneous information networks. Departing from many existing network models that view interconnected data as homogeneous graphs or networks, our semi-structured heterogeneous information network model leverages the rich semantics of typed nodes and links in a network and uncovers surprisingly rich knowledge from the network. This semi-structured heterogeneous network modeling leads to a series of new principles and powerful methodologies for mining interconnected data, including: (1) rank-based clustering and classification; (2) meta-path-based similarity search and mining; (3) relation strength-aware mining, and many other potential developments. This book introduces this new research frontier and points out some promising research directions.

However, documents are also associated with further information, such as the set of real-world entities mentioned in them. For example, news articles are usually related to several people, organizations, countries or locations. Since those associated entities carry rich information, it is highly desirable to build more expressive, entity-based topic models, which can capture the term distributions for each topic, each entity, as well as each topic-entity pair. In this paper, we therefore introduce a novel Entity Topic Model (ETM) for documents that are associated with a set of entities. ETM not only models the generative process of a term given its topic and entity information, but also models the correlation of entity term distributions and topic term distributions.

We first identify the two aspects of QoI, data reliability and data redundancy, and then propose metrics to estimate them. In particular, reliability implies the degree to which a sensor node contributes to the classification mission, and can be estimated through exploring the agreement between this node and the majority of others. On the other hand, redundancy represents the information overlap among different sensor nodes, and can be measured via investigating the similarity of their clustering results. Based on the proposed QoI metrics, we formulate an optimization problem that aims at maximizing the reliability of sensory data while eliminating their redundancies under the constraint of network resources. We decompose this problem into a data selection sub problem and a data transmission sub problem, and develop a distributed algorithm to solve them separately.

Animals usually have periodic movement behaviors, such as daily foraging behaviors or yearly migration behaviors. Such periodic behaviors are the keys to understand animal movement and they also reflect the seasonal, climate, or environmental changes of the ecosystem. However, periodic behaviors could be complicated, involving multiple interleaving periods, partial time span, and spatiotemporal noises and outliers. In this paper, we address the problem of mining periodic behaviors for moving objects. It involves two sub-problems: how to detect the periods in complex movements, and how to mine periodic behaviors. A period is usually a single value, such as 24 h. And a periodic behavior is a statistical description of the periodic movement for one specific period. For example, we could describe an animal's daily behavior in the way that \"From 6 pm to 6 am, it has 90% probability staying at location A and from 7 am to 5 pm, it has 70% probability staying at location B and 30% probability staying at location C\". So our tasks is to first detect the periods and then describe each periodic behavior according to different periods. Our main assumption is that the observed movement is generated from multiple interleaved periodic behaviors associated with certain reference locations. Based on this assumption, we propose a two-stage algorithm, Periodica, to solve the problem. At the first stage, the notion of reference spot is proposed to capture the reference locations. Through reference spots, multiple periods in the movement can be retrieved using a method that combines Fourier transform and autocorrelation. At the second stage, a probabilistic model is proposed to characterize the periodic behaviors. For a specific period, periodic behaviors are statistically generalized from partial movement sequences through hierarchical clustering. Finally, we show two extensions to the Periodica algorithm: (1) missing data interpolation, and (2) future movement prediction. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "year": "2012", "venue": "Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery", "citations": ["5390ba3820f70186a0f371a1"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfa52f", "5390972920f70186a0dfacba", "5390972920f70186a0dfacbc", "5390972920f70186a0dfbe19", "5390985d20f70186a0e06e7b", "5390985d20f70186a0e07dc9", "539098b820f70186a0e0a851", "5390990f20f70186a0e0ff4e", "5390990f20f70186a0e0ff55", "539099b320f70186a0e19a5d", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe65", "53909f8c20f70186a0e401ce", "5390a30b20f70186a0e6a52f", "5390a45620f70186a0e72a43", "5390ac1720f70186a0eb28ce", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec5280", "5390880220f70186a0d75f0b", "5390880720f70186a0d7878b", "53908a5720f70186a0da0bf5", "53908a9620f70186a0da4742", "53908b2a20f70186a0db94c6", "53908b4920f70186a0dbcc08", "53908bde20f70186a0dc94a2"], "authors": ["Zhenhui Li", "Jiawei Han", "Bolin Ding", "Roland Kays"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a754c60b4bee2de1e39a"}}, {"index": "5390b63320f70186a0f177d9", "title": "Mining Knowledge from Data: An Information Network Analysis Approach", "abstract": "Most objects and data in the real world are interconnected, forming complex, heterogeneous but often semistructured information networks. However, many database researchers consider a database merely as a data repository that supports storage and retrieval rather than an information-rich, inter-related and multi-typed information network that supports comprehensive data analysis, whereas many network researchers focus on homogeneous networks. Departing from both, we view interconnected, semi-structured datasets as heterogeneous, information-rich networks and study how to uncover hidden knowledge in such networks. For example, a university database can be viewed as a heterogeneous information network, where objects of multiple types, such as students, professors, courses, departments, and multiple typed relationships, such as teach and advise are intertwined together, providing abundant information. In this tutorial, we present an organized picture on mining heterogeneous information networks and introduce a set of interesting, effective and scalable network mining methods. The topics to be covered include (i) database as an information network, (ii) mining information networks: clustering, classification, ranking, similarity search, and meta path-guided analysis, (iii) construction of quality, informative networks by data mining, (iv) trend and evolution analysis in heterogeneous information networks, and (v) research frontiers.

Most of the existing manifold ranking methods focus on learning a ranking function that varies smoothly along the data manifold. However, beyond smoothness, a desirable ranking function should vary monotonically along the geodesics of the data manifold, such that the ranking order along the geodesics is preserved. In this paper, we aim to learn a ranking function that varies linearly and therefore monotonically along the geodesics of the data manifold. Recent theoretical work shows that the gradient field of a linear function on the manifold has to be a parallel vector field. Therefore, we propose a novel ranking algorithm on the data manifolds, called Parallel Field Ranking. Specifically, we try to learn a ranking function and a vector field simultaneously. We require the vector field to be close to the gradient field of the ranking function, and the vector field to be as parallel as possible. Moreover, we require the value of the ranking function at the query point to be the highest, and then decrease linearly along the manifold.

In this study, we investigate the problem of discovering object groups that travel together (i.e., traveling companions) from trajectory stream. Such technique has broad applications in the areas of scientific study, transportation management and military surveillance. To discover traveling companions, the monitoring system should cluster the objects of each snapshot and intersect the clustering results to retrieve moving-together objects. Since both clustering and intersection steps involve high computational overhead, the key issue of companion discovery is to improve the algorithm's efficiency. We propose the models of closed companion candidates and smart intersection to accelerate data processing. A new data structure termed traveling buddy is designed to facilitate scalable and flexible companion discovery on trajectory stream. The traveling buddies are micro-groups of objects that are tightly bound together. By only storing the object relationships rather than their spatial coordinates, the buddies can be dynamically maintained along trajectory stream with low cost. Based on traveling buddies, the system can discover companions without accessing the object details. The proposed methods are evaluated with extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets.

Concept-evolution occurs when a new class evolves in the stream. Although many recent studies address this issue, most of them do not consider the scenario of recurring classes in the stream. A class is called recurring if it appears in the stream, disappears for a while, and then reappears again. Existing data stream classification techniques either misclassify the recurring class instances as another class, or falsely identify the recurring classes as novel.

In this paper we address the recurring class issue by proposing a novel \"class-based\" ensemble technique, which substitutes the traditional \"chunk-based\" ensemble approaches and correctly distinguishes between a recurring class and a novel one.

From these services, we observed a new type of social network - event-based social network (EBSN). An EBSN does not only contain online social interactions as in other conventional online social networks, but also includes valuable offline social interactions captured in offline activities. By analyzing real data collected from Meetup, we investigated EBSN properties and discovered many unique and interesting characteristics, such as heavy-tailed degree distributions and strong locality of social interactions. We subsequently studied the heterogeneous nature (co-existence of both online and offline social interactions) of EBSNs on two challenging problems: community detection and information flow. We found that communities detected in EBSNs are more cohesive than those in other types of social networks (e.g. location-based social networks). In the context of information flow, we studied the event recommendation problem. By experimenting various information diffusion patterns, we found that a community-based diffusion model that takes into account of both online and offline interactions provides the best prediction power. This paper is the first research to study EBSNs at scale and paves the way for future studies on this new type of social network.

A significant challenge is to summarize and navigate structured data together with unstructured text data for efficient query and analysis. In this paper we introduce a text cube architecture designed to organize social media data in multiple dimensions and hierarchies for efficient information query and visualization from multiple perspectives. For example, an affective process cube allows the analyst to examine public reaction (e.g., sadness, anger) to a range of social phenomena. The text cube architecture also supports the development of prediction models using the summarized statistics stored in a data cube. For example, models that detect events, such as violent protests in the Egyptian Revolution, can be built using the linguistic features stored in an event data cube.

Finding experts with demonstrated expertise for a given query is a nontrivial task especially from a large-scale Web 2.0 systems, such as question answering and bibliography data, where users are actively publishing useful content online, interacting with each other, and forming social networks in various ways, leading to heterogeneous networks in addition to the large amounts of textual content information. Many approaches have been proposed and shown to be useful for expertise ranking. However, most of these methods only consider the textual documents while ignoring heterogeneous network structures or can merely integrate with one additional kind of information. None of them can fully exploit the characteristics of heterogeneous networks. In this paper, we propose a joint regularization framework to enhance expertise retrieval by modeling heterogeneous networks as regularization constraints on top of document-centric model. We argue that multi-typed linking edges reveal valuable information which should be treated differently. Motivated by this intuition, we formulate three hypotheses to capture unique characteristics for different graphs, and mathematically model those hypotheses jointly with the document and other information. To illustrate our methodology, we apply the framework to expert finding applications using a bibliography dataset with 1.1 million papers and 0.7 million authors.

One important research topic in CPS is about the atypical event analysis, i.e., retrieving the events from large amount of data and analyzing them with spatial, temporal and other multi-dimensional information. Many traditional approaches are not feasible for such analysis since they use numeric measures and cannot describe the complex atypical events.

The micro-cluster is designed to summarize individual events, and the macro-cluster is used to integrate the information from multiple event. To facilitate scalable, flexible and online analysis, the concept of significant cluster is defined and a guided clustering algorithm is proposed to retrieve significant clusters in an efficient manner.

First, most existing studies focus only on link prediction in homogeneous networks, where all objects and links belong to the same type. However, in the real world, heterogeneous networks that consist of multi-typed objects and relationships are ubiquitous. Second, most current studies only concern the problem of whether a link will appear in the future but seldom pay attention to the problem of when it will happen. In this paper, we address both issues and study the problem of predicting when a certain relationship will happen in the scenario of heterogeneous networks. First, we extend the link prediction problem to the relationship prediction problem, by systematically defining both the target relation and the topological features, using a meta path-based approach.

Consequently, a major challenge for data integration is to derive the most complete and accurate integrated records from diverse and sometimes conflicting sources. We term this challenge the truth finding problem. We observe that some sources are generally more reliable than others, and therefore a good model of source quality is the key to solving the truth finding problem. In this work, we propose a probabilistic graphical model that can automatically infer true records and source quality without any supervision. In contrast to previous methods, our principled approach leverages a generative process of two types of errors (false positive and false negative) by modeling two different aspects of source quality. In so doing, ours is also the first approach designed to merge multi-valued attribute types. Our method is scalable, due to an efficient sampling-based inference algorithm that needs very few iterations in practice and enjoys linear time complexity, with an even faster incremental variant.

However, an important measure that captures a participant's diversity in the network has been largely neglected in previous studies. Namely, diversity characterizes how diverse a given node connects with its peers. In this paper, we give a comprehensive study of this concept. We first lay out two criteria that capture the semantic meaning of diversity, and then propose a compliant definition which is simple enough to embed the idea. Based on the approach, we can measure not only a user's sociality and interest diversity but also a social media's user diversity.

In many cases, such networks contain multiple types of objects and links, as well as different kinds of attributes. The clustering of these objects can provide useful insights in many applications. However, the clustering of such networks can be challenging since (a) the attribute values of objects are often incomplete, which implies that an object may carry only partial attributes or even no attributes to correctly label itself; and (b) the links of different types may carry different kinds of semantic meanings, and it is a difficult task to determine the nature of their relative importance in helping the clustering for a given purpose. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a model-based clustering algorithm. We design a probabilistic model which clusters the objects of different types into a common hidden space, by using a user-specified set of attributes, as well as the links from different relations. The strengths of different types of links are automatically learned, and are determined by the given purpose of clustering. An iterative algorithm is designed for solving the clustering problem, in which the strengths of different types of links and the quality of clustering results mutually enhance each other.

Most of the existing manifold ranking methods focus on learning a ranking function that varies smoothly along the data manifold.

In this article, we aim to learn a ranking function that varies linearly and therefore monotonically along the geodesics of the data manifold. Recent theoretical work shows that the gradient field of a linear function on the manifold has to be a parallel vector field. Therefore, we propose a novel ranking algorithm on the data manifolds, called Parallel Field Ranking. Specifically, we try to learn a ranking function and a vector field simultaneously. We require the vector field to be close to the gradient field of the ranking function, and the vector field to be as parallel as possible. Moreover, we require the value of the ranking function at the query point to be the highest, and then decrease linearly along the manifold.

People like to discover groups (or cliques) of entities linked to each other with rare and surprising associations from such networks. We define such anomalous cliques as Association-Based Clique Outliers (ABCOutliers) for heterogeneous information networks, and design effective approaches to detect them. The need to find such outlier cliques from networks can be formulated as a conjunctive select query consisting of a set of (type, predicate) pairs. Answering such conjunctive queries efficiently involves two main challenges: (1) computing all matching cliques which satisfy the query and (2) ranking such results based on the rarity and the interestingness of the associations among entities in the cliques. In this paper, we address these two challenges as follows. First, we introduce a new low-cost graph index to assist clique matching. Second, we define the outlierness of an association between two entities based on their attribute values and provide a methodology to efficiently compute such outliers given a conjunctive select query. Experimental results on several synthetic datasets and the Wikipedia dataset containing thousands of entities show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in computing interesting ABCOutliers.", "year": "2013", "venue": "Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining", "citations": ["558c15b40cf2e30013db5219"], "references": ["5390980720f70186a0e040fb", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c6ec", "5390ac1720f70186a0eb28b1", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec525d", "5390b04120f70186a0ed781f", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e2bc", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2c110", "539087f320f70186a0d6fb31", "53908a4020f70186a0d9deee", "53908a5720f70186a0da0b51", "5390958a20f70186a0df0602"], "authors": ["Manish Gupta", "Jing Gao", "Xifeng Yan", "Hasan Cam", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a565c60b4bede9e97889"}}, {"index": "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d13f", "title": "Mining evidences for named entity disambiguation", "abstract": "Named entity disambiguation is the task of disambiguating named entity mentions in natural language text and link them to their corresponding entries in a knowledge base such as Wikipedia.

Most of the existing manifold ranking methods focus on learning a ranking function that varies smoothly along the data manifold. However, beyond smoothness, a desirable ranking function should vary monotonically along the geodesics of the data manifold, such that the ranking order along the geodesics is preserved. In this article, we aim to learn a ranking function that varies linearly and therefore monotonically along the geodesics of the data manifold. Recent theoretical work shows that the gradient field of a linear function on the manifold has to be a parallel vector field. Therefore, we propose a novel ranking algorithm on the data manifolds, called Parallel Field Ranking. Specifically, we try to learn a ranking function and a vector field simultaneously. We require the vector field to be close to the gradient field of the ranking function, and the vector field to be as parallel as possible. Moreover, we require the value of the ranking function at the query point to be the highest, and then decrease linearly along the manifold.

In this paper, we propose the novel concept of Community Distribution Outliers (CDOutliers) for heterogeneous information networks, which are defined as objects whose community distribution does not follow any of the popular community distribution patterns.We extract such outliers using a type-aware joint analysis of multiple types of objects. Given community membership matrices for all types of objects, we follow an iterative two-stage approach which performs pattern discovery and outlier detection in a tightly integrated manner. We first propose a novel outlier-aware approach based on joint non-negative matrix factorization to discover popular community distribution patterns for all the object types in a holistic manner, and then detect outliers based on such patterns.

The need to find such outlier cliques from networks can be formulated as a conjunctive select query consisting of a set of (type, predicate) pairs. Answering such conjunctive queries efficiently involves two main challenges: (1) computing all matching cliques which satisfy the query and (2) ranking such results based on the rarity and the interestingness of the associations among entities in the cliques.

The degree of opacity is directly proportional to the value of the behavioral, social or cultural measure. This kind of map allows the analyst to focus attention on hotspots of concern in a region of interest.

Even though databases are currently used to generate Web content in some sites, the schemas of these databases are rarely consistent across a domain. This makes the comparison and aggregation of information from different domains difficult. We aim to make an important step towards resolving this disparity by using the structural and relational information on the Web to (1) extract Web lists, (2) find entity-pages, (3) map entity-pages to a database, and (4) extract attributes of the entities. Specifically, given a Web site and an entity-page (e.g., university department and faculty member home page) we seek to find all of the entity-pages of the same type (e.g., all faculty members in the department), as well as attributes of the specific entities (e.g., their phone numbers, email addresses, office numbers).

Well-known methods, such as bagging, boosting, and model averaging, have been shown to improve accuracy and robustness over single models. However, due to the high costs of manual labeling, it is hard to obtain sufficient and reliable labeled data for effective training. Meanwhile, lots of unlabeled data exist in these sources, and we can readily obtain multiple unsupervised models. Although unsupervised models do not directly generate a class label prediction for each object, they provide useful constraints on the joint predictions for a set of related objects. Therefore, incorporating these unsupervised models into the ensemble of supervised models can lead to better prediction performance. In this paper, we study ensemble learning with outputs from multiple supervised and unsupervised models, a topic where little work has been done. We propose to consolidate a classification solution by maximizing the consensus among both supervised predictions and unsupervised constraints. We cast this ensemble task as an optimization problem on a bipartite graph, where the objective function favors the smoothness of the predictions over the graph, but penalizes the deviations from the initial labeling provided by the supervised models. We solve this problem through iterative propagation of probability estimates among neighboring nodes and prove the optimality of the solution. The proposed method can be interpreted as conducting a constrained embedding in a transformed space, or a ranking on the graph. Experimental results on different applications with heterogeneous data sources demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method over existing alternatives.

It is highly desirable to sift meaningful information from a large volume of noisy data. In this study, we propose a method called Tru-Alarm, which increases the capability of a CPS to recognize trustworthy alarms. Tru-Alarm estimates the locations of objects causing alarms, constructs an object-alarm graph and carries out trustworthiness inference based on the graph links. The study also reveals that the alarm trustworthiness and sensor reliability could be mutually enhanced. The property is used to help prune the large search space of object-alarm graph, filter out the alarms generated by unreliable sensors and improve the algorithm@?s efficiency.

We observe that different sources are often not independent of each other. Instead, sources are prone to be mutually influenced, which makes them dependent when sharing information with each other. High dependency between sources makes collective intelligence vulnerable to the overuse of redundant (and possibly incorrect) information from the dependent sources. Thus, we reveal the latent group structure among dependent sources, and aggregate the information at the group level rather than from individual sources directly. This can prevent the collective intelligence from being inappropriately dominated by dependent sources.

In this paper, we introduce a novel density-based network clustering method, called graph-skeleton-based clustering (gSkeletonClu). By projecting an undirected network to its core-connected maximal spanning tree, the clustering problem can be converted to detect core connectivity components on the tree. The density-based clustering of a specific parameter setting and the hierarchical clustering structure both can be efficiently extracted from the tree. Moreover, it provides a convenient way to automatically select the parameter and to achieve the meaningful cluster tree in a network. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic networks demonstrate the superior performance of gSkeletonClu for effective and efficient density-based clustering.", "year": "2013", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["Jianbin Huang", "Heli Sun", "Qinbao Song", "Hongbo Deng", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a7d4c60b4bee2de753e3"}}, {"index": "5390bb7b20f70186a0f3fb81", "title": "PathSelClus: Integrating Meta-Path Selection with User-Guided Object Clustering in Heterogeneous Information Networks", "abstract": "Real-world, multiple-typed objects are often interconnected, forming heterogeneous information networks. A major challenge for link-based clustering in such networks is their potential to generate many different results, carrying rather diverse semantic meanings. In order to generate desired clustering, we propose to use meta-path, a path that connects object types via a sequence of relations, to control clustering with distinct semantics. Nevertheless, it is easier for a user to provide a few examples (seeds) than a weighted combination of sophisticated meta-paths to specify her clustering preference. Thus, we propose to integrate meta-path selection with user-guided clustering to cluster objects in networks, where a user first provides a small set of object seeds for each cluster as guidance. Then the system learns the weight for each meta-path that is consistent with the clustering result implied by the guidance, and generates clusters under the learned weights of meta-paths. A probabilistic approach is proposed to solve the problem, and an effective and efficient iterative algorithm, PathSelClus, is proposed to learn the model, where the clustering quality and the meta-path weights mutually enhance each other.

The goal of selective sampling is to achieve a good trade-off between prediction performance and the number of queried labels. Existing selective sampling algorithms are designed for vector-based data. In this paper, motivated by the ubiquity of graph representations in real-world applications, we propose to study selective sampling on graphs. We first present an online version of the well-known Learning with Local and Global Consistency method (OLLGC). It is essentially a second-order online learning algorithm, and can be seen as an online ridge regression in the Hilbert space of functions defined on graphs. We prove its regret bound in terms of the structural property (cut size) of a graph. Based on OLLGC, we present a selective sampling algorithm, namely Selective Sampling with Local and Global Consistency (SSLGC), which queries the label of each node based on the confidence of the linear function on graphs. Its bound on the label complexity is also derived. We analyze the low-rank approximation of graph kernels, which enables the online algorithms scale to large graphs. Experiments on benchmark graph datasets show that OLLGC outperforms the state-of-the-art first-order algorithm significantly, and SSLGC achieves comparable or even better results than OLLGC while querying substantially fewer nodes. Moreover, SSLGC is overwhelmingly better than random sampling.", "year": "2013", "venue": "Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining", "citations": ["558adc19612c41e6b9d3bbaa", "558b98fc612c6b62e5e8c6a3"], "references": ["5390981d20f70186a0e04935", "5390990f20f70186a0e0f1f3", "539099a220f70186a0e171ab", "53909ee020f70186a0e321ed", "5390a17720f70186a0e52415", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e74484", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebdf38", "539087c720f70186a0d56516", "5390b4c420f70186a0efe326", "5390baa120f70186a0f39b96", "539087dd20f70186a0d635ee", "539087e120f70186a0d66736", "53908a4020f70186a0d9d585", "53908a5820f70186a0da1362", "539096cb20f70186a0df8915"], "authors": ["Quanquan Gu", "Charu Aggarwal", "Jialu Liu", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a7f2c60b4bee2de8ef1d"}}, {"index": "5390bf1320f70186a0f50535", "title": "Outlier detection for information networks", "abstract": "The study of networks has emerged in diverse disciplines as a means of analyzing complex relationship data. There has been a significant amount of work in network science which studies properties of networks, querying over networks, link analysis, influence propagation, network optimization, and many other forms of network analysis. Only recently has there been some work in the area of outlier detection for information network data.Outlier (or anomaly) detection is a very broad field and has been studied in the context of a large number of application domains. Many algorithms have been proposed for outlier detection in high-dimensional data, uncertain data, stream data and time series data. By its inherent nature, network data provides very different challenges that need to be addressed in a special way. Network data is gigantic, contains nodes of different types, rich nodes with associated attribute data, noisy attribute data, noisy link data, and is dynamically evolving in multiple ways. This thesis focuses on outlier detection for such networks with respect to two interesting perspectives: (1) community based outliers and (2) query based outliers. For community based outliers, we discuss the problem in both static as well as dynamic settings. Usually objects in a network form multiple communities. Most of the objects follow some popular community distribution patterns and also follow similar patterns of evolution. In a static network setting, one may find some objects each of whose community distribution does not follow any of the popular community distribution patterns. We refer to such outliers as Community Distribution Outliers (CDOutliers). The major challenge lies in extracting community patterns for various object types in an integrated way. We follow an iterative two-stage approach to identify CDOutliers, which performs pattern discovery (based on a joint non-negative matrix factorization approach) and outlier detection in a tightly integrated manner. In the dynamic setting, there are some objects which evolve in a very different way relative to other community members, and we define such objects as temporal community outliers. One of our studies is related to finding such outliers given two snapshots of a network (Evolutionary Community Outliers (ECOutliers) while the other study is more general and focuses on a setting of multiple network snapshots (Community Trend Outliers (CTOutliers). In both the studies, temporal patterns are discovered in an outlier-aware manner, and then outliers are discovered based on such patterns. The major challenge lies in performing cluster matching across snapshots so as to obtain temporal patterns. Another challenge is to define the outlier score once the patterns have been discovered. We propose algorithms and demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms in finding such outliers using both synthetic and real dataset.The other important aspect of my research is query based outlier detection. Given a heterogeneous network and a user subgraph query, the aim is to allow the user to find top-K ranked matches for the query in the network. Matches are ranked based on the rare and surprising associations (expressed as edges) within them. My work focuses on outlier detection with respect to two main kinds of queries: clique queries and general subgraph queries. This work can be useful for many critical applications like finding the most impacted subgraphs in computer networks during network attacks, finding the most critical locations to send extra aid on battlefields, etc. For the clique queries, we propose a low-cost shared neighbors index to assist subgraph matching and then propose a stricter version of negative association strength as a measure of outlierness of an association. The cliques are ranked based on the sum of outlierness of their edges and the top few are returned as Association Based Clique Outliers (ABCOutliers). For general subgraph queries, we discovertop-K outliers by performing matching and outlier scoring in an integrated way. We pre-compute a graph topology index and a graph maximum metapath weight index. We exploit these data structures to propose a novel top-K algorithm for fast computation of subgraph outliers.The proposed concept of outlier detection from networks opens up a new direction of outlier detection research. The detected outliers, which cannot be found by traditional outlier detection techniques, provide new insights into the application area. The algorithms we developed can be applied to many areas, including social network analysis, cyber-security, distributed systems, health care, and bio-informatics. As both the amount of data as well as the linkage increase in a variety of domains, such network-based techniques will find more applications and more opportunities for research for various settings.", "year": "2013", "venue": "Outlier detection for information networks", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["Jiawei Han", "Manish Gupta"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a7f9c60b4bee2de952fe"}}, {"index": "5390bda020f70186a0f45fe3", "title": "MedRank: discovering influential medical treatments from literature by information network analysis", "abstract": "Medical literature has been an important information source for clinical professionals.

In this paper we propose MedRank, a new network-based algorithm that ranks heterogeneous objects in a medical information network. The network is extracted from MEDLINE, a large collection of semi-structured medical literature. Different types of objects such as journal articles, pathological symptoms, diseases, clinical trials, treatments, authors, and journals are linked together through their relationships. The experimental results are compared with the expert rankings collected from doctors and two baseline methods, namely degree centrality and NetClus.

In this paper, we address four such major challenges, namely, infinite length, concept-drift, concept-evolution, and feature-evolution. Since a data stream is theoretically infinite in length, it is impractical to store and use all the historical data for training. Concept-drift is a common phenomenon in data streams, which occurs as a result of changes in the underlying concepts. Concept-evolution occurs as a result of new classes evolving in the stream. Feature-evolution is a frequently occurring process in many streams, such as text streams, in which new features (i.e., words or phrases) appear as the stream progresses. Most existing data stream classification techniques address only the first two challenges, and ignore the latter two. In this paper, we propose an ensemble classification framework, where each classifier is equipped with a novel class detector, to address concept-drift and concept-evolution. To address feature-evolution, we propose a feature set homogenization technique. We also enhance the novel class detection module by making it more adaptive to the evolving stream, and enabling it to detect more than one novel class at a time.

In this paper, we study the entity recommendation problem in heterogeneous information networks. We propose to combine various relationship information from the network with user feedback to provide high quality recommendation results. The major challenge of building recommender systems in heterogeneous information networks is to systematically define features to represent the different types of relationships between entities, and learn the importance of each relationship type. In the proposed framework, we first use meta-path-based latent features to represent the connectivity between users and items along different paths in the related information network. We then define a recommendation model with such latent features and use Bayesian ranking optimization techniques to estimate the model.

In this paper, we show that while past approaches are effective in detecting hotspots using location traces, they are largely ineffective in identifying trips (pairs of pickup and dropoff points). We propose the use of a graph theory concept - stretch factor in a novel manner to identify trip(s) made by a taxicab and show that a Hidden Markov Model based algorithm can identify trips (using real datasets from taxicab deployments in Shanghai and partially simulated datasets from Stockholm) with precision and recall of 90-94%, a significant improvement over past approaches that result in a precision and recall of about 50-60%.", "year": "2013", "venue": "Proceedings of the 2013 ACM international joint conference on Pervasive and ubiquitous computing", "citations": ["558b196e612c41e6b9d43328", "558b298a612c41e6b9d453b3", "558b1fbd612c41e6b9d440d9"], "references": ["53909a0220f70186a0e2021f", "5390a45620f70186a0e730de", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e74c65", "5390a80e20f70186a0e9589f", "5390aaf920f70186a0ead504", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb1a34", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda9b7", "5390b13020f70186a0edcb6c", "5390b13020f70186a0edcb6a", "5390b19020f70186a0edeba8", "5390b29820f70186a0eea5b7", "539089ab20f70186a0d96ba4"], "authors": ["Raghu Ganti", "Mudhakar Srivatsa", "Anand Ranganathan", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a8a7c60b4bee2df267f7"}}, {"index": "5390bae520f70186a0f3bbbd", "title": "Mining heterogeneous information networks: a structural analysis approach", "abstract": "Most objects and data in the real world are of multiple types, interconnected, forming complex, heterogeneous but often semi-structured information networks.

Furthermore, the data on social news Web sites is extremely well organized by its user-base, which opens the door for opportunities to leverage this data for other purposes just like Wikipedia data has been used for many other purposes. In this paper we study a popular social news Web site called Reddit.

The CPS has wide applications in scenarios such as environment monitoring, battlefield surveillance and traffic control. One key research problem of CPS is called \"mining lines in the sand\". With a large number of sensors (sand) deployed in a designated area, the CPS is required to discover all the trajectories (lines) of passing intruders in real time. There are two crucial challenges that need to be addressed: (1) the collected sensor data are not trustworthy; (2) the intruders do not send out any identification information. The system needs to distinguish multiple intruders and track their movements. In this study, we propose a method called LiSM (Line-in-the-Sand Miner) to discover trajectories from untrustworthy sensor data. LiSM constructs a watching network from sensor data and computes the locations of intruder appearances based on the link information of the network. The system retrieves a cone-model from the historical trajectories and tracks multiple intruders based on this model. Finally the system validates the mining results and updates the sensor's reliability in a feedback process.

Such bugs are not localized to one component that is faulty, but rather result from complex and unexpected interactions between multiple often individually nonfaulty components. Moreover, the manifestations of these bugs are often not repeatable, making them particularly hard to find, as the particular sequence of events that invokes the bug may not be easy to reconstruct. Because of the distributed nature of failure scenarios, our tool looks for sequences of events that may be responsible for faulty behavior, as opposed to localized bugs such as a bad pointer in a module. We identified several challenges in applying discriminative sequence mining for root cause analysis when the system fails to perform as expected and presented our solutions to those challenges. We also present two alternative schemes, namely, two-stage mining and the progressive discriminative sequence mining to address the scalability challenge. An extensible framework is developed where a front-end collects runtime data logs of the system being debugged and an offline back-end uses frequent discriminative pattern mining to uncover likely causes of failure. We provided several case studies where we applied our tool successfully to troubleshoot the cause of the problem. We uncovered a kernel-level race condition bug in the LiteOS operating system and a protocol design bug in the directed diffusion protocol. We also presented a case study of debugging a multichannel MAC protocol that was found to exhibit corner cases of poor performance (worse than single-channel MAC). The tool helped to uncover event sequences that lead to a highly degraded mode of operation. Fixing the problem significantly improved the performance of the protocol. We also evaluated the extensions presented in this article.

Moreover, our models can determine the diffusion power of each relation type, which helps us understand the diffusion process better in the multi-relational bibliographic network scenario.", "year": "2014", "venue": "Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management", "citations": [], "references": ["5390ac1720f70186a0eb28c6", "539096cb20f70186a0df7a0f", "5390880d20f70186a0d7bf4e", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda9c3", "5390958a20f70186a0df05c6", "5390b2d720f70186a0eec911", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2ee66", "5390a25820f70186a0e5e852", "5390b1d220f70186a0ee23a1", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e256", "5390b04120f70186a0ed6e05", "5390af8820f70186a0eced7d", "53909ed120f70186a0e30f20", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3cdc7", "5390b71120f70186a0f1e2f5", "5390b36120f70186a0ef129b", "5390a17720f70186a0e5247f"], "authors": ["Huan Gui", "Yizhou Sun", "Jiawei Han", "George Brova"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a638c60b4bee2dd46a1c"}}, {"index": "5390bda020f70186a0f46ff3", "title": "Troubleshooting interactive complexity bugs in wireless sensor networks using data mining techniques", "abstract": "This article presents a tool for uncovering bugs due to interactive complexity in networked sensing applications. Such bugs are not localized to one component that is faulty, but rather result from complex and unexpected interactions between multiple often individually nonfaulty components. Moreover, the manifestations of these bugs are often not repeatable, making them particularly hard to find, as the particular sequence of events that invokes the bug may not be easy to reconstruct. Because of the distributed nature of failure scenarios, our tool looks for sequences of events that may be responsible for faulty behavior, as opposed to localized bugs such as a bad pointer in a module. We identified several challenges in applying discriminative sequence mining for root cause analysis when the system fails to perform as expected and presented our solutions to those challenges. We also present two alternative schemes, namely, two-stage mining and the progressive discriminative sequence mining to address the scalability challenge. An extensible framework is developed where a front-end collects runtime data logs of the system being debugged and an offline back-end uses frequent discriminative pattern mining to uncover likely causes of failure. We provided several case studies where we applied our tool successfully to troubleshoot the cause of the problem. We uncovered a kernel-level race condition bug in the LiteOS operating system and a protocol design bug in the directed diffusion protocol. We also presented a case study of debugging a multichannel MAC protocol that was found to exhibit corner cases of poor performance (worse than single-channel MAC). The tool helped to uncover event sequences that lead to a highly degraded mode of operation. Fixing the problem significantly improved the performance of the protocol. We also evaluated the extensions presented in this article. Finally, we provided a detailed analysis of tool overhead in terms of memory requirements and impact on the running application.", "year": "2014", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks (TOSN)", "citations": [], "references": ["5390975920f70186a0dfe3b6", "539098b820f70186a0e09cbc", "539098b820f70186a0e0a7c6", "539098dd20f70186a0e0e2fc", "5390995d20f70186a0e14b40", "5390995d20f70186a0e14b3e", "539099a220f70186a0e190d7", "53909a0220f70186a0e1f2d4", "53909e8b20f70186a0e2e4d1", "53909ee020f70186a0e31e1c", "53909ee020f70186a0e31ecc", "53909ee020f70186a0e32280", "53909ee020f70186a0e32bb2", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40f87", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4ba27", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4ba34", "5390a1d420f70186a0e5745d", "5390a25820f70186a0e5efb4", "5390a25820f70186a0e5efb5", "5390a25820f70186a0e5efb3", "5390a45620f70186a0e72a5c", "5390a54620f70186a0e77ae1", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7f70c", "5390a6d920f70186a0e86f8c", "5390a72220f70186a0e8901e", "5390a96f20f70186a0ea3c42", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea8453", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea8452", "5390ac5720f70186a0eb4da6", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba3e8", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebdf3e", "5390880220f70186a0d75ed5", "5390880220f70186a0d78336", "53908a5820f70186a0da0f9d", "53908a9620f70186a0da4bb0", "5390958920f70186a0deebd5", "539095ba20f70186a0df0d89"], "authors": ["Mohammad Maifi Hasan Khan", "Hieu Khac Le", "Hossein Ahmadi", "Tarek F.

The category information also provides important ranking features that can be used to improve search experience. However, category hierarchies are often manually crafted by some human experts and they are far from complete. Manually constructed category hierarchies cannot handle the ever-changing and sometimes long-tail user information needs. In this paper, we study the problem of how to expand an existing category hierarchy for a search/navigation system to accommodate the information needs of users more comprehensively. We propose a general framework for this task, which has three steps: 1) detecting meaningful missing categories; 2) modeling the category hierarchy using a hierarchical Dirichlet model and predicting the optimal tree structure according to the model; 3) reorganizing the corpus using the complete category structure, i.e., associating each webpage with the relevant categories from the complete category hierarchy.

In this study, we investigate the problem of discovering object groups that travel together (i.e., traveling companions) from trajectory data streams. Such technique has broad applications in the areas of scientific study, transportation management, and military surveillance. To discover traveling companions, the monitoring system should cluster the objects of each snapshot and intersect the clustering results to retrieve moving-together objects. Since both clustering and intersection steps involve high computational overhead, the key issue of companion discovery is to improve the efficiency of algorithms. We propose the models of closed companion candidates and smart intersection to accelerate data processing. A data structure termed traveling buddy is designed to facilitate scalable and flexible companion discovery from trajectory streams. The traveling buddies are microgroups of objects that are tightly bound together. By only storing the object relationships rather than their spatial coordinates, the buddies can be dynamically maintained along the trajectory stream with low cost. Based on traveling buddies, the system can discover companions without accessing the object details. In addition, we extend the proposed framework to discover companions on more complicated scenarios with spatial and temporal constraints, such as on the road network and battlefield. The proposed methods are evaluated with extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed buddy-based approach is an order of magnitude faster than the baselines and achieves higher accuracy in companion discovery.", "year": "2014", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST) - Special Section on Intelligent Mobile Knowledge Discovery and Management Systems and Special Issue on Social Web Mining", "citations": ["558b6095612c4440fcaaec9b", "558aee3f612c41e6b9d3daaa", "558bd1d20cf23f2dfc593ad6"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfa7f0", "5390972920f70186a0dfba3b", "5390972920f70186a0dfbe48", "5390979920f70186a0dffd84", "5390979920f70186a0dffd83", "5390985e20f70186a0e09113", "539098dc20f70186a0e0dc72", "53909a0220f70186a0e203d3", "53909ee020f70186a0e31e6f", "53909eef20f70186a0e359e7", "53909f2d20f70186a0e39509", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3fe56", "5390a17720f70186a0e52872", "5390a1e620f70186a0e59b6f", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d5bf", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d5c3", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5d5c5", "5390a37f20f70186a0e6bc25", "5390a45620f70186a0e72a7c", "5390a79f20f70186a0e9234e", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea6dcb", "5390ab8820f70186a0eb0098", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba332", "5390ad0620f70186a0eba333", "5390adfc20f70186a0ec5280", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec807a", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed4516", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed4517", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda946", "5390b13020f70186a0eddc85", "5390b36120f70186a0ef12b6", "5390b44620f70186a0ef819f", "5390b63320f70186a0f177c1", "5390b63320f70186a0f177c9", "5390b71120f70186a0f1f9ed", "5390877920f70186a0d2cb6e", "539087f820f70186a0d711dd", "5390880720f70186a0d7876d", "53908a5720f70186a0da0132", "53908a7420f70186a0da4548", "53908d6620f70186a0dd2f8f", "5390962020f70186a0df4cb4"], "authors": ["Lu-An Tang", "Yu Zheng", "Jing Yuan", "Jiawei Han", "Alice Leung", "Wen-Chih Peng", "Thomas La Porta"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a6a1c60b4bee2dd9d8c7"}}, {"index": "5390bf1320f70186a0f5097c", "title": "Learning to efficiently rank on big data", "abstract": "Ranking in response to user queries is a central problem in information retrieval, data mining, and machine learning.

Since then, outlier detection has been studied on a large variety of data types including high-dimensional data, uncertain data, stream data, network data, time series data, spatial data, and spatio-temporal data. While there have been many tutorials and surveys for general outlier detection, we focus on outlier detection for temporal data in this book. A large number of applications generate temporal datasets. For example, in our everyday life, various kinds of records like credit, personnel, financial, judicial, medical, etc., are all temporal. This stresses the need for an organized and detailed study of outliers with respect to such temporal data. In the past decade, there has been a lot of research on various forms of temporal data including consecutive data snapshots, series of data snapshots and data streams. Besides the initial work on time series, researchers have focused on rich forms of data including multiple data streams, spatio-temporal data, network data, community distribution data, etc. Compared to general outlier detection, techniques for temporal outlier detection are very different. In this book, we will present an organized picture of both recent and past research in temporal outlier detection. We start with the basics and then ramp up the reader to the main ideas in state-of-the-art outlier detection techniques. We motivate the importance of temporal outlier detection and brief the challenges beyond usual outlier detection. Then, we list down a taxonomy of proposed techniques for temporal outlier detection.

Most existing studies assume that all papers adopt the same criterion and follow the same behavioral pattern in deciding relevance and authority of a paper. However, in reality, papers have distinct citation behavioral patterns when looking for different references, depending on paper content, authors and target venues. In this study, we investigate the problem in the context of heterogeneous bibliographic networks and propose a novel cluster-based citation recommendation framework, called ClusCite, which explores the principle that citations tend to be softly clustered into interest groups based on multiple types of relationships in the network.

Specifically, we learn group memberships for objects and the significance of relevance features for each interest group, while also propagating relative authority between objects, by solving a joint optimization problem.

As a consequence, conflicts among these sources are inevitable, which leads to an important task: how to identify which piece of information is trustworthy, i.e., the truth discovery task. Intuitively, if the piece of information is from a reliable source, then it is more trustworthy, and the source that provides trustworthy information is more reliable. Based on this principle, truth discovery approaches have been proposed to infer source reliability degrees and the most trustworthy information (i.e., the truth) simultaneously. However, existing approaches overlook the ubiquitous long-tail phenomenon in the tasks, i.e., most sources only provide a few claims and only a few sources make plenty of claims, which causes the source reliability estimation for small sources to be unreasonable. To tackle this challenge, we propose a confidence-aware truth discovery (CATD) method to automatically detect truths from conflicting data with long-tail phenomenon. The proposed method not only estimates source reliability, but also considers the confidence interval of the estimation, so that it can effectively reflect real source reliability for sources with various levels of participation.

However, existing online learning algorithms on a graph are limited to binary classification. Moreover, they require accessing the full label information, where the label oracle needs to return the true class label after the learner makes classification of each node. In many application scenarios, we only have access to partial label information, where the label oracle will return a single bit indicating whether the prediction is correct or not, instead of the true class label. This is also known as bandit feedback. In this paper, to overcome the above limitations of existing online learning algorithms on a graph, we study online learning on a graph for multi-class node classification, in both the full information setting and the partial information setting. First, we present an online multi-class classification algorithm in the full information setting. It is based on function learning on a graph using the spectral information of the graph Laplacian. We show that it attains O (cd log T) regret bound, where T is the number of rounds in online learning, c is the number of classes, and d is the number of eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian used for learning. Second, we present an online multi-class classification algorithm with bandit feedback. We use upper-confidence bound technique to trade off the exploration and exploitation of label information. We show that it attains O (cd \u221aT log T) regret bound, which is only a \u221aT factor worse than the proposed algorithm in the full information setting.

This paper studies the critical alert mining problem: Given a set of alert sequences, we aim to find a set of k critical alerts such that the number of alerts potentially triggered by them is maximized. We show that the problem is intractable; therefore, we resort to approximation and heuristic algorithms. First, we develop an approximation algorithm that obtains a near-optimal alert set in quadratic time, and propose pruning techniques to improve its runtime performance. Moreover, we show a faster approximation exists, when the alerts follow certain causal structure. Second, we propose two fast heuristic algorithms based on tree sampling techniques.

The task to link named entity mentions detected from the unstructured Web text with their corresponding entities existing in a heterogeneous information network is of practical importance for the problem of information network population and enrichment. This task is challenging due to name ambiguity and limited knowledge existing in the information network. Most existing entity linking methods focus on linking entities with Wikipedia or Wikipedia-derived knowledge bases (e.g., YAGO), and are largely dependent on the special features associated with Wikipedia (e.g., Wikipedia articles or Wikipedia-based relatedness measures). Since heterogeneous information networks do not have such features, these previous methods cannot be applied to our task. In this paper, we propose SHINE, the first probabilistic model to link the named entities in Web text with a heterogeneous information network to the best of our knowledge. Our model consists of two components: the entity popularity model that captures the popularity of an entity, and the entity object model that captures the distribution of multi-type objects appearing in the textual context of an entity, which is generated using meta-path constrained random walks over networks. As different meta-paths express diverse semantic meanings and lead to various distributions over objects, different paths have different weights in entity linking. We propose an effective iterative approach to automatically learning the weights for each meta-path based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm without requiring any training data.

Unfortunately, classic sequential pattern mining algorithms developed for transactional data cannot effectively mine patterns in semantic trajectories, mainly because the places in the continuous space cannot be regarded as independent \\\"items\\\". Instead, similar places need to be grouped to collaboratively form frequent sequential patterns. That said, it remains a challenging task to mine what we call fine-grained sequential patterns, which must satisfy spatial compactness, semantic consistency and temporal continuity simultaneously. We propose Splitter to effectively mine such fine-grained sequential patterns in two steps. In the first step, it retrieves a set of spatially coarse patterns, each attached with a set of trajectory snippets that precisely record the pattern's occurrences in the database. In the second step, Splitter breaks each coarse pattern into fine-grained ones in a top-down manner, by progressively detecting dense and compact clusters in a higher-dimensional space spanned by the snippets. Splitter uses an effective algorithm called weighted snippet shift to detect such clusters, and leverages a divide-and-conquer strategy to speed up the top-down pattern splitting process.

Most of the previous studies in this category only consider a single relationship type, such as friendships in a social network. In many scenarios, the entity recommendation problem exists in a heterogeneous information network environment. Different types of relationships can be potentially used to improve the recommendation quality. In this paper, we study the entity recommendation problem in heterogeneous information networks. Specifically, we propose to combine heterogeneous relationship information for each user differently and aim to provide high-quality personalized recommendation results using user implicit feedback data and personalized recommendation models. In order to take full advantage of the relationship heterogeneity in information networks, we first introduce meta-path-based latent features to represent the connectivity between users and items along different types of paths. We then define recommendation models at both global and personalized levels and use Bayesian ranking optimization techniques to estimate the proposed models.

As a result, this will inevitably lead to data or information conflicts. One important problem is to identify the true information (i.e., the truths) among conflicting sources of data. It is intuitive to trust reliable sources more when deriving the truths, but it is usually unknown which one is more reliable a priori. Moreover, each source possesses a variety of properties with different data types. An accurate estimation of source reliability has to be made by modeling multiple properties in a unified model. Existing conflict resolution work either does not conduct source reliability estimation, or models multiple properties separately. In this paper, we propose to resolve conflicts among multiple sources of heterogeneous data types. We model the problem using an optimization framework where truths and source reliability are defined as two sets of unknown variables. The objective is to minimize the overall weighted deviation between the truths and the multi-source observations where each source is weighted by its reliability. Different loss functions can be incorporated into this framework to recognize the characteristics of various data types, and efficient computation approaches are developed. Experiments on real-world weather, stock and flight data as well as simulated multi-source data demonstrate the necessity of jointly modeling different data types in the proposed framework.", "year": "2014", "venue": "Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data", "citations": ["55323bd245cec66b6f9daa8e", "559166b80cf2e89307ca9937"], "references": ["53909a9320f70186a0e231eb", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebcfd5", "5390a1f820f70186a0e5ddee", "539096cb20f70186a0df8915", "5390a1d420f70186a0e58223", "5390a79f20f70186a0e9231f", "5390a79f20f70186a0e922eb", "5390bd1520f70186a0f42de4", "5390a88c20f70186a0e993bd", "5390b63320f70186a0f17cb8", "5390ae2e20f70186a0ec84b5", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f34d0b", "5390b60d20f70186a0f12850", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3d396", "5390882d20f70186a0d8dc9b", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda99f", "53909f2d20f70186a0e39557", "5390b48420f70186a0efa9b7"], "authors": ["Qi Li", "Yaliang Li", "Jing Gao", "Bo Zhao", "Wei Fan", "Jiawei Han"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a8c1c60b4bee2df3b447"}}, {"index": "558acb49612c41e6b9d3a4e6", "title": "Frequent Pattern Mining", "abstract": "This comprehensive reference consists of 18 chapters from prominent researchers in the field.

Thus, we propose to extend MoveMine to MoveMine 2.0 by adding substantial new methods in mining dynamic relationship patterns. Newly added methods focus on two types of pairwise relationship patterns: (i) attraction/avoidance relationship, and (ii) following pattern. A user-friendly interface is designed to support interactive exploration of the result and provides flexibility in tuning parameters.

In enterprises, extracting entities improves enterprise efficiency by facilitating numerous applications, including search, recommendation, etc. However, the problem is particularly challenging on enterprise domains due to several reasons. First, the lack of redundancy of enterprise entities makes previous web-based systems like NELL and OpenIE not effective, since using only high-precision/low-recall patterns like those systems would miss the majority of sparse enterprise entities, while using more low-precision patterns in sparse setting also introduces noise drastically. Second, semantic drift is common in enterprises (\\\"Blue\\\" refers to \\\"Windows Blue\\\"), such that public signals from the web cannot be directly applied on entities. Moreover, many internal entities never appear on the web. Sparse internal signals are the only source for discovering them. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end framework for extracting entities in enterprises, taking the input of enterprise corpus and limited seeds to generate a high-quality entity collection as output. We introduce the novel concept of Semantic Pattern Graph to leverage public signals to understand the underlying semantics of lexical patterns, reinforce pattern evaluation using mined semantics, and yield more accurate and complete entities.

The CPS has wide applications in scenarios such as environment monitoring, battlefield surveillance, and traffic control. One key research problem of CPS is called mining lines in the sand. With a large number of sensors (sand) deployed in a designated area, the CPS is required to discover all trajectories (lines) of passing intruders in real time. There are two crucial challenges that need to be addressed: (1) the collected sensor data are not trustworthy, and (2) the intruders do not send out any identification information. The system needs to distinguish multiple intruders and track their movements. This study proposes a method called LiSM (Line-in-the-Sand Miner) to discover trajectories from untrustworthy sensor data. LiSM constructs a watching network from sensor data and computes the locations of intruder appearances based on the link information of the network. The system retrieves a cone model from the historical trajectories to track multiple intruders. Finally, the system validates the mining results and updates sensors\u2019 reliability scores in a feedback process. In addition, LoRM (Line-on-the-Road Miner) is proposed for trajectory discovery on road networks\u2014mining lines on the roads. LoRM employs a filtering-and-refinement framework to reduce the distance computational overhead on road networks and uses a shortest-path-measure to track intruders.

It is widely used in online websites, including social network sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter to make data-driven decisions. The goal of A/B testing is to estimate the treatment effect of a new change, which becomes intricate when users are interacting, i.e., the treatment effect of a user may spill over to other users via underlying social connections.When conducting these online controlled experiments, it is a common practice to make the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) that each individual's response is affected by their own treatment only. Though this assumption simplifies the estimation of treatment effect, it does not hold when network interference is present, and may even lead to wrong conclusion. In this paper, we study the problem of network A/B testing in real networks, which have substantially different characteristics from the simulated random networks studied in previous works. We first examine the existence of network effect in a recent online experiment conducted at LinkedIn; Secondly, we propose an efficient and effective estimator for Average Treatment Effect (ATE) considering the interference between users in real online experiments; Finally, we apply our method in both simulations and a real world online experiment.

Most algorithms for community detection assume that the entire network is available for online analysis. In practice, this is not really true, because only restricted portions of the network may be available at any given time for analysis. Many social networks such as Facebook have privacy constraints, which do not allow the discovery of the entire structure of the social network. Even in the case of more open networks such as Twitter, it may often be challenging to crawl the entire network from a practical perspective. For many other scenarios such as adversarial networks, the discovery of the entire network may itself be a costly task, and only a small portion of the network may be discovered at any given time. Therefore, it can be useful to investigate whether network mining algorithms can integrate the network discovery process tightly into the mining process, so that the best results are achieved for particular constraints on discovery costs. In this context, we will discuss algorithms for integrating community detection with network discovery. We will tightly integrate with the cost of actually discovering a network with the community detection process, so that the two processes can support each other and are performed in a mutually cohesive way.
