[{"index": "539087f820f70186a0d72b7d", "title": "A fuzzy commitment scheme", "abstract": "We combine well-known techniques from the areas of error-correcting codes and cryptography to achieve a new type of cryptographic primitive that we refer to as a fuzzy commitment scheme. Like a conventional cryptographic commitment scheme, our fuzzy commitment scheme is both concealing and binding: it is infeasible for an attacker to learn the committed value, and also for the committer to decommit a value in more than one way. In a conventional scheme, a commitment must be opened using a unique witness, which acts, essentially, as a decryption key. By contrast, our scheme is fuzzy in the sense that it accepts a witness that is close to the original encrypting witness in a suitable metric, but not necessarily identical.This characteristic of our fuzzy commitment scheme makes it useful for applications such as biometric authentication systems, in which data is subject to random noise. Because the scheme is tolerant of error, it is capable of protecting biometric data just as conventional cryptographic techniques, like hash functions, are used to protect alphanumeric passwords. This addresses a major outstanding problem in the theory of biometric authentication. We prove the security characteristics of our fuzzy commitment scheme relative to the properties of an underlying cryptographic hash function.", "year": "1999", "venue": "CCS '99 Proceedings of the 6th

Using the same graphical format for both input and output results in an interface that is powerful, flexible, yet easy to use.", "year": "2001", "venue": "CHI '01 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems", "citations": ["5390981d20f70186a0e04e0f", "53909a0220f70186a0e201a2", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3f784", "53909f8c20f70186a0e40e48", "5390a5b020f70186a0e7d90d", "5390a5b020f70186a0e7d95b", "5390a6b120f70186a0e842be", "5390a6b120f70186a0e842c0", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea09c5", "5390b24320f70186a0ee6a28", "5390b56a20f70186a0f066bc", "5390b95520f70186a0f2f716", "558ae5ee612c41e6b9d3cbfb", "558afd92612c41e6b9d3fcd5", "558e42170cf2c779a6477dee", "559163670cf2e89307ca981b", "5390881820f70186a0d80f0e", "5390881820f70186a0d80eff", "53908a5720f70186a0d9fc12", "53908b1820f70186a0db4aa0", "539096cb20f70186a0df882c"], "references": ["539087aa20f70186a0d4bdf1", "539087c720f70186a0d56e12", "53908a9620f70186a0da4cf1"], "authors": ["Martin Wattenberg"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a625c60b4bee2dd378e4"}}, {"index": "53908cde20f70186a0dcd8bb", "title": "Ordered Treemap Layouts", "abstract": "Treemaps, a space-filling method of visualizing large hierarchical data sets, are receiving increasing attention.

The core of our method is a new formal model of one type of perceptual structure, based on classical machine vision techniques for analyzing an image at multiple resolutions. The model takes as input an arbitrary grayscale image and returns a lattice structure describing the visual organization of the image. We show how this model captures several aspects of traditional design aesthetics, and we describe a software tool that implements the model to help designers analyze and refine visual displays. Our emphasis here is on demonstrating the model's potential as a design aid rather than as a description of human perception, but given its initial promise we propose a variety of ways in which the model could be extended and validated.", "year": "2003", "venue": "INFOVIS'03 Proceedings of the Ninth annual IEEE conference on Information visualization", "citations": ["5390979920f70186a0dffced", "5390990f20f70186a0e11051", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea1c20", "5390afc920f70186a0ed22cb", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed593b"], "references": ["539098dc20f70186a0e0d7d6", "5390877920f70186a0d2ea56", "539087a120f70186a0d45bc3", "539087a620f70186a0d49edc", "539087b320f70186a0d4edf3", "5390a6b120f70186a0e847f2", "5390877920f70186a0d2d202", "5390878e20f70186a0d39efa", "5390879220f70186a0d3d6b0", "5390879220f70186a0d3d6ef", "5390879520f70186a0d3e760", "539087d420f70186a0d5df9b", "539087ef20f70186a0d6c5c1", "539087fe20f70186a0d74b5e", "539087fe20f70186a0d75987", "5390880720f70186a0d7a7c3", "5390882120f70186a0d8579d", "539089d320f70186a0d9b679", "53908af920f70186a0daef82", "53908af920f70186a0daf098"], "authors": ["Martin Wattenberg", "Danyel Fisher"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a73fc60b4bee2de0e64f"}}, {"index": "53908b4920f70186a0dbacf8", "title": "Conversation thumbnails for large-scale discussions", "abstract": "We present a new interface for large-scale online conversations.

First, we introduce a new exploratory data analysis tool, the history flow visualization, which is effective in revealing patterns within the wiki context and which we believe will be useful in other collaborative situations as well. Second, we discuss several collaboration patterns highlighted by this visualization tool and corroborate them with statistical analysis. Third, we discuss the implications of these patterns for the design and governance of online collaborative social spaces. We focus on the relevance of authorship, the value of community surveillance in ameliorating antisocial behavior, and how authors with competing perspectives negotiate their differences.", "year":

The core of our method is a new formal model of one type of perceptual structure, based on classical machine vision techniques for analyzing an image at multiple resolutions. The model takes as input an arbitrary grayscale image and returns a lattice structure describing the visual organization of the image. We show how this model captures several aspects of traditional design aesthetics, and we describe a software tool that implements the model to help designers analyze and refine visual displays.

First, a pragmatic, system-level approach reveals that e-mail programs are generally used idiosyncratically, often for many different goals at once. This fact has strong implications for both the design and assessment of new features. Second, we discuss how viewing e-mail as an element of corporate collaboration--not just communication--provides insights into problems with current systems as well as potential solutions. Third, we describe constraints imposed by the realities of software development and how they shape the space of feasible new designs. Finally, we illustrate these lessons with an overview of CUE research strategies in the context of an extended case study of one specific new technology: Thread Arcs.

This paper describes the results of an empirical analysis of Wikipedia and discusses ways in which the Wikipedia community has evolved as it has grown. We contrast our findings with an earlier study [11] and present three main results. First, the community maintains a strong resilience to malicious editing, despite tremendous growth and high traffic. Second, the fastest growing areas of Wikipedia are devoted to coordination and organization. Finally, we focus on a particular set of pages used to coordinate work, the \"Talk\" pages. By manually coding the content of a subset of these pages, we find that these pages serve many purposes, notably supporting strategic planning of edits and enforcement of standard guidelines and conventions. Our results suggest that despite the potential for anarchy, the Wikipedia community places a strong emphasis on group coordination, policy, and process.", "year": "2007", "venue": "HICSS '07 Proceedings of the 40th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences", "citations": ["53909f8220f70186a0e3c67e", "53909f8220f70186a0e3c682", "53909f8220f70186a0e3c686", "53909f8c20f70186a0e4016d", "53909fbc20f70186a0e416d8", "5390a01420f70186a0e4830e", "5390a01420f70186a0e4884e", "5390a0b720f70186a0e4f6a1", "5390a17720f70186a0e52422", "5390a25820f70186a0e5f032", "5390a25820f70186a0e5f034", "5390a40520f70186a0e6e5b3", "5390a40520f70186a0e6f54a", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7ef92", "5390a5dc20f70186a0e7efdb", "5390a63c20f70186a0e83371", "5390a6d920f70186a0e86625", "5390a6d920f70186a0e8847f", "5390a6d920f70186a0e88481", "5390a6d920f70186a0e88480", "5390a6d920f70186a0e88476", "5390a6d920f70186a0e8857b", "5390a72220f70186a0e8ac3e", "5390a72220f70186a0e8af58", "5390a7f520f70186a0e934e7", "5390a88c20f70186a0e994c2", "5390a88c20f70186a0e994c1", "5390a88c20f70186a0e994ce", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea0626", "5390a93b20f70186a0ea05f7", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea5b36", "5390a9a520f70186a0ea6d4e", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea79ad", "5390aa0e20f70186a0ea79ba", "5390aa0f20f70186a0ea8aca", "5390aaf920f70186a0eaf042", "5390aaf920f70186a0eaf04c", "5390ac1820f70186a0eb4003", "5390ac5720f70186a0eb5d63", "5390ad0720f70186a0ebc1cd", "5390ad5620f70186a0ebe92a", "5390aeba20f70186a0ec99a0", "5390aeba20f70186a0ec99a7", "5390aeba20f70186a0ec9993", "5390aeba20f70186a0ec9991", "5390aefc20f70186a0ecdde8", "5390afc920f70186a0ed2ca3", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed5780", "5390b19020f70186a0edf478", "5390b19020f70186a0ee0d5c", "5390b20120f70186a0ee5303", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef5a3b", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef5a40", "5390b3da20f70186a0ef5a59", "5390b44620f70186a0ef8eef", "5390b52620f70186a0f044aa", "5390b56a20f70186a0f06cd5", "5390b71120f70186a0f1fa5c", "5390b7fe20f70186a0f26d88", "5390b86b20f70186a0f28998", "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a40e", "5390b8d720f70186a0f2b331", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f32ef6", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f3380f", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f33886", "5390ba0a20f70186a0f34afd", "5390baa120f70186a0f37d24", "5390baa120f70186a0f37d27", "5390baa120f70186a0f37d32", "5390baa120f70186a0f3948c", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3db0b", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3db02", "5390bb1d20f70186a0f3db05", "5390bf1320f70186a0f5195e", "558b7951612c6b62e5e89665"], "references": [], "authors": ["Fernanda B.

By making these tools available to anyone on the web, the site fosters a social style of data analysis that empowers users to engage with public data through discussion and collaboration. Political discussions, citizen activism, religious conversations, game playing, and educational exchanges are all happening on Many Eyes.
