Angiograms are typically noisy, fuzzy, and contain thin vessel structures. Therefore, some kinds of enhancements are usually needed before direct volume rendering can start. However, without visualizing the 3D structures in angiograms, users may find it difficult to select appropriate parameters and assess the effectiveness of the enhancement results. In addition, traditional enhancement techniques cannot easily separate the vessel voxels from other contextual structures with the same or very similar intensity. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate enhancement and direct volume rendering into one visualization pipeline using multi-dimensional transfer function tailored for visualizing the curvilinear and line structures in angiograms.

One of the key perceptual factors is that whether and how the visible differences between two images will be observed by users. In this paper we propose a perceptual framework, which is based on the Visible Differences Predictor (VDP), for comparing the direct volume rendered images generated with different algorithms or the same algorithm with different specifications such as shading method, gradient estimation scheme, and sampling rate. Our framework consists of a volume rendering engine and a VDP component.

In our pipeline, various relations in the volume are first defined and measured using region connection calculus (RCC) and then represented using a graph interface called relation graph. With RCC and the relation graph, relation query and interactive exploration can be conducted in a comprehensive and intuitive way.

Due to the explosive increase in size and complexity of the data, the analysis tasks involved pose difficult problems. Volume visualization provides an effective solution which aims at delivering insights of the underlying details or concepts by the means of computer graphics for creating useful views on the data. In fact, effective visualization requires the support of intuitive and interactive exploration techniques as well as proper rendering and presentation of the data in order to facilitate the users in acquiring insights and useful information from the volumes. This thesis focuses on the improvement of the rendered image quality and the exploration pipeline to facilitate the visualization process. In this thesis, we first present two exploration techniques for visualizing volumetric data. Instead of performing tedious manipulation on the volumes, we suggest a quality-driven camera path planning method and a relation-aware visualization pipeline to allow semi-automatic exploration of volumes. Volume features and high-level spatial relations are considered to determine the proper views on the volumes and our objective is to reveal this important information using the proposed visualization techniques. In the second part, the issues of rendered image quality are discussed and we propose two image quality enhancement approaches to ensure that the features in the volume are faithfully presented in the rendered images and correct perception of the volumes is obtained by viewers. An adaptive enhancement framework is also proposed to adjust the rendering parameters for obtaining optimal rendered images.

However, these schemes mainly focus on the optimization of visualization in the 3D space where cluttering and occlusion make grasping even a few thousand fibers difficult. This paper introduces a novel interaction method that augments the 3D visualization with a 2D representation containing a low-dimensional embedding of the DTI fibers. This embedding preserves the relationship between the fibers and removes the visual clutter that is inherent in 3D renderings of the fibers. This new interface allows the user to manipulate the DTI fibers as both 3D curves and 2D embedded points and easily compare or validate his or her results in both domains.

In this thesis, we present four methods for improving the intuitiveness and effectiveness of direct volume rendering as follows. (1) An editing framework for direct volume rendered images, allowing users to interactively explore complex volumetric datasets by directly editing direct volume rendered images. (2) A palette-style volume visualization method, which can automatically store and systematically organize intermediate results created during a volume visualization process, such that users can locate their desired results quickly and generate a new result based on the editing framework.

It turns complex and abstract data such as demographic data, financial data, social networks, and paper citations into visual representations, and then users can exploit interactive computer graphics techniques and human visual capabilities to gain insight into the data. Parallel coordinates and graphs are two well-established methods in information visualization. However, when data become very large, the effectiveness of both methods is dramatically reduced as tens of thousands of lines can easily overwhelm the display and the resulting visual clutter will obscure any underlying patterns. Thus, clutter reduction for parallel coordinates and graphs is a very important research problem in information visualization. In this thesis, we introduce visual clustering as a new approach for clutter reduction and pattern detection. Compared with traditional clutter reduction methods such as filtering and brushing, visual clustering can enhance and reveal interesting patterns in the data while preserving the context. For parallel coordinates, we present a force-based optimization method to bundle polylines by adjusting their shapes, and a splatting framework to reveal features with animations.

Data in text format such as digitalized textural data and data from new social media like blogs and Twitter have been generated at an unprecedented rate. For example, Google Books has scanned and digitalized 15 million books, greatly increasing the accessibility of information all around the world. Twitter publishes more than 300 new messages every second, and the numbers keep increasing. However, exploring and analyzing this enormous amount of data become increasingly difficult. Information visualization can help analyze huge and complex data by turning them into visual representations to exploit the tremendous pattern-recognition capability of the human visual system. In this thesis, we propose three advanced text visualization techniques for summarizing and exploring various relation patterns existing in large time-varying text document collections. This thesis is composed of three main parts, each of which addresses an important problem in text visualization. In the first part, we present an enhanced word cloud layout that keeps the semantic relations between the displayed words in a sequence of word clouds generated over time for dynamic document data. In the second part, TextWheel is introduced to visualize complex micro-macro relations within news streams. In the last part, we deal with the splitting/merging patterns between topics that are extracted from text streams.

Solar Map simultaneously visualizes the topic distribution of the underlying entities from one facet together with keyword distributions that convey the semantic definition of each cluster along a secondary facet. Solar Map combines several visual techniques including 1) topic contour clusters and interactive multifaceted keyword topic rings, 2) a global layout optimization algorithm that aligns each topic cluster with its corresponding keywords, and 3) 2) an optimal temporal network segmentation and layout method that renders temporal evolution of clusters. Finally, the paper concludes with two case studies and quantitative user evaluation which show the power of the Solar Map technique.", "year": "2011", "venue": "ICDM '11 Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on Data Mining", "citations": ["5390bae520f70186a0f3bd6d", "558b34a2612c41e6b9d469a7"], "references": [], "authors": ["Nan Cao", "David Gotz", "Jimeng Sun", "Yu-Ru Lin", "Huamin Qu"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a8cdc60b4bee2df450d2"}}, {"index": "5390b86b20f70186a0f2a402", "title": "Proceedings of the 5th International Symposium on Visual Information Communication and Interaction", "abstract": "Welcome to the International Symposium on Visual Information Communication and Interaction 2012 (VINCI 2012) held at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China, from September 27th to 28th, 2012.

Social media, like Twitter, has been increasingly used for exchanging information, opinions and emotions about events that are happening across the world. Here we propose a novel visualization design, \u201cWhisper\u201d, for tracing the process of information diffusion in social media in real time. Our design highlights three major characteristics of diffusion processes in social media: the temporal trend, social-spatial extent, and community response of a topic of interest. Such social, spatiotemporal processes are conveyed based on a sunflower metaphor whose seeds are often dispersed far away. In Whisper, we summarize the collective responses of communities on a given topic based on how tweets were retweeted by groups of users, through representing the sentiments extracted from the tweets, and tracing the pathways of retweets on a spatial hierarchical layout. We use an efficient flux line-drawing algorithm to trace multiple pathways so the temporal and spatial patterns can be identified even for a bursty event. A focused diffusion series highlights key roles such as opinion leaders in the diffusion process. We demonstrate how our design facilitates the understanding of when and where a piece of information is dispersed and what are the social responses of the crowd, for large-scale events including political campaigns and natural disasters.

However, news articles usually have other attributes such as source, author, date and time, length, and sentiment which should be taken into account. In addition, news articles and keywords have complicated macro/micro relations, which include relations between news articles (i.e., macro relation), relations between keywords (i.e., micro relation), and relations between news articles and keywords (i.e., macro-micro relation). These macro/micro relations are time varying and pose special challenges for news analysis. In this article we present a visual analytics system for news streams which can bring multiple attributes of the news articles and the macro/micro relations between news streams and keywords into one coherent analytical context, all the while conveying the dynamic natures of news streams. We introduce a new visualization primitive called TextWheel which consists of one or multiple keyword wheels, a document transportation belt, and a dynamic system which connects the wheels and belt. By observing the TextWheel and its content changes, some interesting patterns can be detected.

For very large time series data with thousands of items, how to visually present ranking changes is an interesting challenge. In this paper, we propose RankExplorer, a novel visualization method based on ThemeRiver to reveal the ranking changes. Our method consists of four major components: 1) a segmentation method which partitions a large set of time series curves into a manageable number of ranking categories; 2) an extended ThemeRiver view with embedded color bars and changing glyphs to show the evolution of aggregation values related to each ranking category over time as well as the content changes in each ranking category; 3) a trend curve to show the degree of ranking changes over time; 4) rich user interactions to support interactive exploration of ranking changes.

Our key observation is that metropolitan transportation data are inherently visual as they are spatio-temporal around road networks. Therefore, we visualize and manage traffic data, together with digital maps, and support analytical queries through this interactive visual interface.

In this paper, based on taxi trajectory data, we present an interactive visual analytics system, T-Watcher, for monitoring and analyzing complex traffic situations in big cities. Users are able to use a carefully designed interface to monitor and inspect data interactively from three levels (region, road and vehicle views). We develop a visualization method to monitor and analyze traffic patterns for abnormal behaviors detection. In the region view of our system, global temporal changes in spatial evolution will be presented to users and can be interactively explored. The road view shows temporal changes to the traffic situations of significant segments of roads. The vehicle view uses a novel visualization method to track individual vehicles. Furthermore, the three views integrate important statistical and historical information related to traffic, which illustrate temporal changes of the traffic. We find that this design can help users explore historical information while monitoring traffic. We test our system on a real-life vehicle dataset collected from thousands of taxis and obtained some interesting findings.

The experiments on several real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "year": "2014", "venue": "Proceedings of the 7th International Symposium on Visual Information Communication and Interaction", "citations": [], "references": ["5390979920f70186a0e010c6", "539087cf20f70186a0d5b66d", "539087f820f70186a0d72a2c", "5390b20120f70186a0ee507f", "5390956e20f70186a0ded95e", "53908cde20f70186a0dcd8d8", "5390b95520f70186a0f2f78e", "5390b95520f70186a0f2f73f", "5390b95520f70186a0f2f737", "5390990f20f70186a0e10037", "53908b0320f70186a0db246a", "5390a28020f70186a0e62bb0", "5390b95520f70186a0f2f736", "53909a9320f70186a0e21aa5", "5390b95520f70186a0f2f72e", "5390b63320f70186a0f17bdc", "53909ee020f70186a0e32fb5", "5390b20120f70186a0ee5081", "53908b0320f70186a0db251a", "539096cb20f70186a0df6aa0", "5390990f20f70186a0e10030", "5390a6d920f70186a0e87dbc", "5390b95520f70186a0f2f738"], "authors": ["Hong Zhou", "Panpan Xu", "Zhong Ming", "Huamin Qu"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a70cc60b4bee2dde8b5a"}}, {"index": "5390c04520f70186a0f56308", "title": "Embedding Temporal Display into Maps for Occlusion-Free Visualization of Spatio-temporal Data", "abstract": "It is often necessary to analyze spatio-temporal data such as traffic flow, air pollution, and vehicle trajectories in a city. A map is often used to show the spatial context while various temporal displays like time series plots can be used to present the changes in the data over time. In this paper, we present a novel visualization that can seamlessly embed temporal displays into a map for occlusion-free visualization of both the spatial and temporal attributes of the data. We first extend the seam carving algorithm to broaden the roads of interest in a map with the least distortion to other areas, and then embed temporal displays into the roads to reveal temporal patterns without the occlusion of map information. We study various design choices in our method, including the encoding of the time direction and temporal display, and conduct two comprehensive user studies to validate our design decisions. We also demonstrate the usability of our approach with case studies on real traffic flow data in a major city.", "year": "2014", "venue": "PACIFICVIS '14 Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["Guodao Sun", "Yang Liu", "Wenbin Wu", "Ronghua Liang", "Huamin Qu"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a834c60b4bee2dec60df"}}, {"index": "5390bf1320f70186a0f50b65", "title": "CAD/Graphics 2013: An image-space energy-saving visualization scheme for OLED displays", "abstract": "Current energy-saving color design approaches can be classified into two categories, namely, context-aware dimming and color remapping. The former darkens individual regions with respect to the user interactions, and the latter replaces the color set with a new color set that yields lower energy consumption. Both schemes have drawbacks: color dimming tends to cause loss of perceptual quality, and color remapping is an offline color design process. This paper introduces a novel saliency-guided color dimming scheme for OLED displays in both the context of 3D visualization and 2D visualization. The key idea is to eliminate undesired details while enhancing the visually salient features of each frame on-the-fly by leveraging the color and spatial information. A parallelizable image-space salient region detection algorithm is introduced to make the entire process GPU-friendly and real-time. We apply our approach on several representative visualization scenarios and conduct a preliminary user study. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of our approach.", "year": "2014", "venue": "Computers and Graphics", "citations": [], "references": ["5390975920f70186a0dfd5fb", "5390975920f70186a0dfe351", "5390979920f70186a0dffce4", "539098dc20f70186a0e0ddfe", "539099a220f70186a0e17ed5", "539099ed20f70186a0e1e49f", "53909ee020f70186a0e32af1", "53909f2d20f70186a0e3877d", "5390a4cc20f70186a0e750ec", "5390b00c20f70186a0ed6458", "5390b0ca20f70186a0edb6ac", "5390b60d20f70186a0f1127a", "5390b72e20f70186a0f227d1", "5390881d20f70186a0d822f0", "5390882d20f70186a0d8debe", "5390893e20f70186a0d92805", "53908d6520f70186a0dd1616", "5390956e20f70186a0ded7b2"], "authors": ["Haidong Chen", "Ji Wang", "Weifeng Chen", "Huamin Qu", "Wei Chen"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a87ac60b4bee2df001cb"}}, {"index": "554111230cf2adbd8385c3ea", "title": "Visualization of bipartite relations between graphs and sets", "abstract": "", "year": "2015", "venue": "Journal of Visualization", "citations": [], "references": [], "authors": ["Hong Zhou", "Panpan Xu", "Huamin Qu"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a73ac60b4bee2de0a57e"}}]
