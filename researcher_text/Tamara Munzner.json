We can lay out much larger structures than can be handled using traditional techniques for drawing general graphs because we assume a hierarchical nature of the data. We impose a hierarchy on the graph by using domain-specific knowledge to find an appropriate spanning tree. Links which are not part of the spanning tree do not influence the layout but can be selectively drawn by user request. The volume of hyperbolic 3-space increases exponentially, as opposed to the familiar geometric increase of euclidean 3-space. We exploit this exponential amount of room by computing the layout according to the hyperbolic metric. We optimize the cone tree layout algorithm for 3D hyperbolic space by placing children on a hemisphere around the cone mouth instead of on its perimeter. Hyperbolic navigation affords a Focus+Context view of the structure with minimal visual clutter. We have successfully laid out hierarchies of over 20,000 nodes.

Our layout and drawing algorithms support interactive navigation of large graphs up to 100,000 edges. We present an adaptive drawing algorithm with a guaranteed frame rate. Both layout and navigation occur in 3D hyperbolic space, which provides a view of a large neighborhood around an easily changeable point of interest. We find an appropriate spanning tree to use as the backbone for fast layout and uncluttered drawing, and non-tree links can be displayed on demand. Our methods are appropriate when node or link annotations can guide the choice of a good parent from among all of the incoming links. Such annotations can be constructed using only a small amount of domain-specific knowledge, thus rendering tractable many graphs which may seem rather densely connected at first glance.", "year": "1998", "venue": "GD '98 Proceedings of the 6th International Symposium on Graph Drawing", "citations": ["539098dc20f70186a0e0ce58", "53909a0220f70186a0e1f07f", "53909f6920f70186a0e3a5f1", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4c6cc", "5390a1d420f70186a0e56d25", "5390a7f520f70186a0e9433c", "5390ac1820f70186a0eb385a", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecaff1", "5390b04120f70186a0ed8ac4", "5390b0ca20f70186a0eda4ef", "5390b48420f70186a0efba9b", "5390b64020f70186a0f1a0f4", "5390b7ff20f70186a0f276ab", "5390b7ff20f70186a0f276eb", "5390b7ff20f70186a0f2770a", "5390b7ff20f70186a0f27cef", "5390bb7b20f70186a0f3fb0d", "539087fe20f70186a0d74eae", "5390880220f70186a0d76a45", "539089bb20f70186a0d98656", "539089bb20f70186a0d98883", "53908b0220f70186a0db150c", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc3de", "53908b4920f70186a0dbc863", "53908cde20f70186a0dcd8c7", "53908cde20f70186a0dcd8dc", "53908cde20f70186a0dcd8cd", "53908e0020f70186a0dd49f8", "5390958920f70186a0dee863", "5390962020f70186a0df475e", "539096cb20f70186a0df702a"], "references": ["5390879d20f70186a0d442a5", "539087ae20f70186a0d4e407", "539087cf20f70186a0d5c7ff", "539087d420f70186a0d5dfb1", "539087e120f70186a0d65872", "539089bb20f70186a0d98f6e", "539089bb20f70186a0d98fbe", "539089d220f70186a0d9a0d7", "539089d320f70186a0d9b485", "53908b0320f70186a0db2474", "53908b0320f70186a0db2cc9", "53908b0320f70186a0db2cbc", "53908cde20f70186a0dcd87a"], "authors": ["Tamara Munzner"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a741c60b4bee2de0fcce"}}, {"index": "539089bb20f70186a0d98fbe", "title": "Exploring Large Graphs in 3D Hyperbolic Space", "abstract": "Graphs have a very natural visual representation as nodes and connecting links arranged in space. Although many examples show the computational manipulation of large data sets that can be expressed in graph form, visual representations of them as graphs are not common. Current tools are inadequate for the job: conventional systems are often challenged by hundreds of edges, and none can handle more than a few thousand edges. However, nonvisual manipulation of graphs with 50,000 edges is commonplace, and much larger instances exist.A graph drawing system that focuses on the interactive browsing of large graphs can be targeted for the quite different tasks of browsing and exploration.

We present TreeJuxtaposer, a system designed to support the comparison task for large trees of several hundred thousand nodes. We introduce the idea of \"guaranteed visibility\", where highlighted areas are treated as landmarks that must remain visually apparent at all times. We propose a new methodology for detailed structural comparison between two trees and provide a new nearly-linear algorithm for computing the best corresponding node from one tree to another. In addition, we present a new rectilinear Focus+Context technique for navigation that is well suited to the dynamic linking of side-by-side views while guaranteeing landmark visibility and constant frame rates. These three contributions result in a system delivering a fluid exploration experience that scales both in the size of the dataset and the number of pixels in the display. We have based the design decisions for our system on the needs of a target audience of biologists who must understand the structural details of many phylogenetic, or evolutionary, trees.

This paper proposes a new methodology to empirically investigate the effect of various Focus+Context transformations on human perception. This methodology is based on the shaker paradigm, which tests performance for a visual task on an image that is rapidly alternated with a transformed version of itself. An important aspect of this technique is that it can determine two different kinds of perceptual cost: (i) the effect on the perception of a static transformed image, and (ii) the effect of the dynamics of the transformation itself. This technique has been successfully applied to determine the extent to which human perception is invariant to scaling and rotation [Rensink 2004]. In this paper, we extend this approach to examine nonlinear fisheye transformations of the type typically used in a Focus+Context system. We show that there exists a no-cost zone where performance is unaffected by an abrupt, noticeable fisheye transformation, and that its extent can be determined. The lack of perceptual cost in regards to these sudden changes contradicts the belief that they are necessarily detrimental to performance, and suggests that smoothly animated transformations between visual states are not always necessary. We show that this technique also can map out low-cost zones where transformations result in only a slight degradation of performance. Finally, we show that rectangular grids have no positive effect on performance, acting only as a form of visual clutter. These results therefore demonstrate that the perceptual costs of nonlinear transformations can be successfully quantified. Interestingly, they show that some kinds of sudden transformation can be experienced with minimal or no perceptual cost. This contradicts the belief that sudden changes are necessarily detrimental to performance, and suggests that smoothly animated transformations between visual states are not always necessary.", "year": "2004", "venue": "APGV '04 Proceedings of the 1st Symposium on Applied perception in graphics and visualization", "citations": ["539099a220f70186a0e179d7"], "references": ["5390972920f70186a0dfa828", "5390972920f70186a0dfa820", "5390877920f70186a0d2d531", "5390877f20f70186a0d310ee", "5390879220f70186a0d3c5db", "539087be20f70186a0d51a81", "539087be20f70186a0d51a7f", "539087c320f70186a0d54402", "539087c720f70186a0d56d89", "539087c720f70186a0d585a1", "539087cf20f70186a0d5c3ae", "539087d420f70186a0d5dfb1", "539087d420f70186a0d5f659", "539087fe20f70186a0d74b5e", "5390880d20f70186a0d7b806", "5390881720f70186a0d8047c", "5390881720f70186a0d806dc", "5390893e20f70186a0d93341", "53908a4020f70186a0d9db9e", "53908cde20f70186a0dcd887", "53908cde20f70186a0dcd868", "53908cde20f70186a0dcd87a", "53908e0020f70186a0dd49f8", "5390962020f70186a0df3b4f"], "authors": ["Keith Lau", "Ronald A.

We present MDSteer, a steerable MDS computation engine and visualization tool that progressively computes an MDS layout and handles datasets of over one million points. Our technique employs hierarchical data structures and progressive layouts to allow the user to steer the computation of the algorithm to the interesting areas of the dataset. The algorithm iteratively alternates between a layout stage in which a sub-selection of points are added to the set of active points affected by the MDS iteration, and a binning stage which increases the depth of the bin hierarchy and organizes the currently unplaced points into separate spatial regions. This binning strategy allows the user to select onscreen regions of the layout to focus the MDS computation into the areas of the dataset that are assigned to the selected bins.

However, no algorithm has yet been presented for carrying out such navigation methods; our paper addresses this problem. For maximum flexibility with large datasets, a stretch and squish navigation algorithm should allow for millions of potentially deformable regions. However, typical usage only changes the extents of a small subset k of these n regions at a time. The challenge is to avoid computations that are linear in n, because a single deformation can affect the absolute screen-space location of every deformable region.

For the task we studied, point-based spatializations were far superior to landscapes, and 2D landscapes were superior to 3D landscapes. Little or no benefit was found for redundantly encoding data using colour or greyscale combined with landscape height. 3D landscapes with no colour scale (height-only) were particularly slow and inaccurate. A colour scale was found to be better than a greyscale for all display types, but a greyscale was helpful compared to height-only.

To better guide design tradeoff between display capacity and visual target perceivability, we looked at overview use in two multiple-VIR interfaces with high-VIR displays either embedded within, or separate from, the overviews. We studied two visual requirements for effective overview and found that participants would reliably use the low-VIR overviews only when the visual targets were simple and had small visual spans. Otherwise, at least 20% chose to use the high-VIR view exclusively. Surprisingly, neither of the multiple-VIR interfaces provided performance benefits when compared to using the high-VIR view alone.

Steerability allows exploration to begin immediately, rather than requiring a costly layout of the entire graph as an initial step. In a feature-based approach, the subgraph inside a metanode of the graph hierarchy is laid out with a well- chosen algorithm appropriate for its topological structure. Grouse preserves the input hierarchy, which provides meaningful information to the user when its metanodes correspond to features of interest. When a metanode in the hierarchy is opened, a limited number of metanodes are laid out again along the path between the opened node and the root. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Grouse on datasets from IMDB, the Internet Movie Database, where nodes are actors and cliques represent movies.

No existing visualization tool can visually encode the biologically interesting relationships between multiple pathways, multiple genes, and multiple species. We tackle the challenge of visualizing all aspects of this comparative functional genomics dataset with a new interactive tool called Pathline. In addition to the overall characterization of the problem and design of Pathline, our contributions include two new visual encoding techniques. One is a new method for linearizing metabolic pathways that provides appropriate topological information and supports the comparison of quantitative data along the pathway.

This definition of guideline allows analysis of how the validation efforts in different kinds of papers typically lead to different kinds of guidelines. Analysis through the lens of blocks and guidelines also led us to identify four major needs: a definition of the meaning of block at the problem level; mid-level task taxonomies to fill in the blocks at the abstraction level; refinement of the model itself at the abstraction level; and a more complete set of mappings up from the algorithm level to the technique level.

The previous workflow required the scientists who built the models to spearhead the analysis process. The features of Vismon include sensitivity analysis, comprehensive and global trade-offs analysis, and a staged approach to the visualization of the uncertainty of the underlying simulation model. The tool was iteratively refined through a multi-year engagement with fisheries scientists with a two-phase approach, where an initial diverging experimentation phase to test many alternatives was followed by a converging phase where the set of multiple linked views that proved effective were integrated together in a useable way.

We discuss implications for the evaluation of existing work practices, for the design of controlled experiments, and for the analysis of post-deployment field observations.", "year": "2014", "venue": "Proceedings of the Fifth Workshop on Beyond Time and Errors: Novel Evaluation Methods for Visualization", "citations": ["558acab2612c41e6b9d3a401"], "references": ["558acab2612c41e6b9d3a401", "5390990f20f70186a0e10035", "5390979920f70186a0e010cd", "5390b20120f70186a0ee503e", "5390be6620f70186a0f4bbc4", "5390a1d420f70186a0e56d20", "5390b68720f70186a0f1cdb7", "5390958920f70186a0deea74", "539099ec20f70186a0e1d6a5", "5390a2e920f70186a0e67190", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4cada", "539087fe20f70186a0d75034", "5390a6d920f70186a0e87dbb", "5390b72e20f70186a0f227a0", "539099ec20f70186a0e1d6b0", "53908e0020f70186a0dd4a22", "539087cf20f70186a0d5b8b8", "5390880d20f70186a0d7b803", "5390a6d920f70186a0e87da8", "5390985d20f70186a0e07e58", "5390a45620f70186a0e73574", "5390985d20f70186a0e08615", "5390be6620f70186a0f4bbc3", "5390be6620f70186a0f4bbdf", "5390b64020f70186a0f1aabf", "53908bcc20f70186a0dc6e1b", "539099ec20f70186a0e1d6a8", "5390af8820f70186a0ecec1d", "5390a06e20f70186a0e4cadb", "539099ec20f70186a0e1d6b1", "5390882820f70186a0d8b0ae", "5390b52620f70186a0f033d7", "5390979920f70186a0e010c2", "5390af8920f70186a0ed0ae1", "5390aeba20f70186a0ecaff7", "53909f8c20f70186a0e3f784", "539087e720f70186a0d69090"], "authors": ["Matthew Brehmer", "Michael Sedlmair", "Stephen Ingram", "Tamara Munzner"], "_id": {"$oid": "5797a6c4c60b4bee2ddb7ccd"}}]
